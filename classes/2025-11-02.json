    "title": "Foreword; The Pre-eminent Qualities of the Author",
    "content": [
      "The excellent expounder, the great Spiritual Master Kelsang Gyatso, studied myriad Buddhist scriptures at the famous Je College of the great monastic university of Sera, Tegchen Ling, practised the meaning of the teachings he received, and became a wise, serious and realized Teacher. From the rain of profound and extensive Dharma that he has bestowed upon his fortunate disciples, he has recently given comprehensive instruction on the great Bodhisattvacharyavatara (Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life). This commentary has now been made available in English with the title Meaningful to Behold, known in Tibetan as 'tong pa don den'.",
      "This text is the heart essence of all the Sugatas of the three times and is the unsurpassed practice of the great Sons of the Conquerors. It explains clearly the mind of bodhichitta developed through equalizing and exchanging self with others -- the foundation of the Bodhisattva's way of life. It also explains the benefits of this Mahayana mind, the way we should guard this mind, and how we should practise the great waves of the six perfections once bodhichitta has been cultivated. As a great gathering of the paths of the Mahayana tradition, it is therefore worthy to receive many flowers of praise bestowed with appreciation.",
      "I pray and dedicate that all sentient beings may practise sincerely the meaning of the instructions explained in this text and may thereby accomplish effortlessly the purposes of both themselves and others. May they all swiftly reach the enlightened state of the four bodies [of a Buddha] by accomplishing all the stages of the spiritual grounds and paths.",

      "Acknowledgements",
      "The teachings contained in this book were originally delivered as a series of lectures to students at Manjushri Kadampa Meditation Centre in England, by Venerable Geshe Kelsang Gyatso Rinpoche. For more than three months, beginning in late 1977, Venerable Geshe Kelsang gave a verse by verse oral commentary to Shantideva's eighth-century masterpiece, Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life, one of the most famous and important texts studied in Mahayana Buddhism.",
      "From the depths of our hearts, we thank the author for his inconceivable kindness in composing this book. Throughout the presentation and revision of these teachings, Venerable Geshe Kelsang has demonstrated by his compassion, wisdom and inexhaustible patience that the Bodhisattva path to enlightenment is still being followed 1,200 years after Shantideva and 2,500 years after the passing away of Buddha Shakyamuni. There can be no greater proof of the immense value of the Bodhisattva's way of life than the living example of such a realized Master.",
      "We also thank all the dedicated, senior Dharma students who assisted the author with the rendering of the English and who prepared the final manuscript for publication.",
      "Please note that numbers in squared brackets throughout the text refer to verse numbers in Shantideva's root text, Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life, a full translation of which is available separately. See Bibliography.",

      "THE PRE-EMINENT QUALITIES OF THE AUTHOR",
      "It is customary at the beginning of commentaries such as this to give a biography of the author, in this case the great Indian Pandit Shantideva (687-763 CE). There now follows a very brief account drawn from traditional sources.",
      "Shantideva was born the crown prince of a royal family in Gujarat, a kingdom in western India. His father was King Kushalavarmana (Armour of Virtue) and his mother was recognized as an emanation of the Tantric Deity Vajrayogini. At his birth the prince received the name Shantivarmana (Armour of Peace).",
      "Even as a very young boy Shantivarmana showed great ability in spiritual matters and by the age of seven was already highly skilled in the inner science of religion. His principal Teacher at that time was a Yogi who had so fully developed penetrating wisdom that it is said he achieved unity with Manjushri, the Buddha embodying the wisdom of all enlightened beings. When Shantivarmana himself engaged in a meditation retreat, he too received a direct vision of Manjushri and many prophetic omens as well.",
      "Shortly afterwards King Kushalavarmana died, leaving Shantivarmana to inherit the throne. The night before his intended coronation, however, Manjushri appeared to him in a dream. He told the prince that he should renounce his kingdom and become a celibate monk. Immediately upon waking, Shantivarmana fled the palace and disappeared into the forest to meditate. Once again he received a vision of Manjushri, who handed him a symbolic wooden sword. Upon taking it Shantivarmana attained eight perfect realizations. He then travelled to the great monastic university of Nalanda where he took ordination from the Abbot Jayadeva (God of Victory) and was given the ordination name of Shantideva (God of Peace).",
      "At Nalanda Shantideva's spiritual development progressed rapidly, especially as the result of his training in the profound and demanding methods of Tantra. However, because he did all his practices secretly at night and rested during the day, it appeared to others that he performed only three activities: eating, sleeping and defecating. For this reason, the other monks sarcastically referred to him as the 'Three Realizations'. Feeling he was a very irresponsible monk and a discredit to their illustrious university, they devised a plan to get rid of him. Incorrectly believing him to be deficient in meditational ability and ignorant of doctrinal theory, they arranged for Shantideva to deliver a discourse before the entire monastery. Their idea was that he would be so humiliated by this exposure of his ignorance that he would be shamed into leaving.",
      "When the day of the scheduled public humiliation arrived, Shantideva mounted the teaching throne and, much to the amazement of those assembled, delivered a discourse which, when written down, became known as Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life, still considered the best set of instructions ever written for becoming a Bodhisattva -- a being bound for full enlightenment. As he was expounding the ninth chapter dealing with the wisdom apprehending the true nature of reality he uttered the words, 'Everything is like space.' At this point he began to rise into the sky, flying higher and higher until he could no longer be seen although his voice could still be clearly heard. It was in this miraculous manner that the remainder of the ninth chapter and the entirety of the tenth were delivered.",
      "Having no desire to return to Nalanda, Shantideva left for South India. Needless to say, the monks he left behind were profoundly impressed and somewhat bewildered by Shantideva's teachings and his display of miracle powers. Shortly thereafter a dispute arose about these teachings. The Kashmiri Pandits claimed that Shantideva taught only nine chapters, while some of the scholars from Magadha, who possessed great powers of memorization, argued that he had in fact taught ten. It was decided that the only way to resolve this disagreement would be to hear the teachings once again, so several monks left Nalanda in search of the one they had once despised and requested him to repeat his discourse. This he did, and he also gave them the text of his Compendium of Trainings (Skt. Shikshasamuchchaya), which also explains the practices of a Bodhisattva. From that time onwards the study and practice of Shantideva's works flourished widely throughout India and other Mahayana Buddhist lands.",
      "As Shantideva's fame spread farther and farther, many non-Buddhists became jealous. One of their greatest teachers, Shankadeva, challenged Shantideva to a debate on the condition that the loser forsake his own doctrine for that of the winner. By the use of miracle powers and impeccable logic, Shantideva emerged victorious, thereby bringing Shankadeva and all of his disciples into the Buddhist fold.",
      "On another occasion, when there was great famine in South India, Shantideva announced that he would perform an act of generosity. The next day many people gathered to see what he would do. Shantideva then proceeded to satisfy the hunger of the entire mass of people with a single bowl of rice! Because of this the local people all developed great faith in Shantideva and adopted the Buddhist way of life as their own.",
      "This has been only a brief biography of the great Bodhisattva Shantideva, who throughout his entire life performed countless deeds for the sake of spreading Buddha's teachings, the Dharma, and helping sentient beings. Even today those who are fortunate enough to read, study and meditate on his outstanding texts can find them a source of great insight and benefit.",
