        "There's a wrong conception that meditation is about doing one formal practice and then riding that through the day. That's a made-up concept \u2014 nothing to do with Kadampa Buddhism.",
        "As Geshe-la says in Modern Buddhism, Kadampa Buddhism cannot be separated from daily life. We want our whole day to be a sadhana.",

        "They're like outposts where we connect to a powerful, positive, virtuous feeling \u2014 even if just for 30 seconds or a minute. That feeling then slowly leaks out into the time in between.",
        "If you do this for a month in a way you really like \u2014 not rigid or rote \u2014 these cognitive structures will just be there. They'll start to function on their own, like an engine that runs itself."

        "The meal-oriented version: Wake up, breakfast, lunch, dinner, bedtime, plus a seated practice somewhere.",
        "The every-3-hours version: Great for retirees or unstructured days. Those hours become sacred \u2014 you know exactly what you do at 12, at 3, at 6.",
        "The variable version: For those whose days are all different. Batch by themes \u2014 match sessions to pain points like commutes or difficult transitions."

        "You can start off strong, but if you don't get those middle two, you just slowly descend all day. Then at the end, you try to pick up from where you got to.",
