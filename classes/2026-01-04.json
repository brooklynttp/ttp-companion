      "Play with what it's like to reduce self-interest, or even have zero self-interest \u2014 like making a beautiful cozy bed knowing you'll sleep in the street.",
      "Focus on people's very subtle mind (their Buddha nature) rather than their physical appearance \u2014 it makes everyone feel more equal.",

        "Even as you walk down the street, notice: who do we like? Who do we not like? Who do we not care about? We're instantaneously preferring people and projecting prejudices onto people we know nothing about.",
        "What are the dividing lines your mind makes? Gender? Ethnicity? Class? Nationality? Religion? Behavior? Hobbies? We want to look at these because we're trying to become a Bodhisattva \u2014 a friend of the world."

        "When we get stuck in physicality, people seem quite different. But if we move past the physical \u2014 which is just a sheath, completely ephemeral, actually not related to that person at all \u2014 everyone starts to feel more equal.",

        "Often we call someone an enemy because we get something out of it \u2014 but it's something maladaptive. For example, a distraction from our own pain. It's much easier to blame others than to look at what's going on in our own mind.",
