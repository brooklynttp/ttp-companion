      "Throughout the day, label everything as uncertain: 'This is going to change' or 'This is uncertain' — good experiences, bad experiences, boring experiences, all of it.",
      "Notice the suffering of uncertainty when it arises — the worry, the anxiety of not knowing what will happen — and name it: 'That's the suffering of uncertainty.'",
      "When something bad or unexpected happens, catch it: 'That's the suffering of uncertainty. All friends will leave at some point. All conditions will change.'",
      "If resistance comes up, check three questions: (1) Do I really want to overcome my attachment? (2) Do I believe I can? (3) Do I have a mental image of what non-attachment looks like that I love?",
      "Let this reflection naturally lead to investing in your peaceful mind and virtues as the real tools for navigating uncertainty."

        "The class opened with heartfelt practice shares, including a reflection on a sangha member Joshua's recent passing. At his memorial service, his ex-wife spoke about how Buddhism had transformed him — his happiest day was a walk at Greenwood Cemetery with the sangha, and how touched he was when everyone sang him happy birthday.",
        "KK reflected on the word 'important' as almost a technical term. When we meditate on equalizing self and others, we think: 'You are important. Your happiness and freedom are important.' This sense of weight — not heavy, but impactful — is what we want to cultivate. What we do here is important. When I meditate, it's really important. When I love others, it's really important."

      "quote": "What we do here is really important. It's not just a trite, fun thing we're up to. It's actually really important."

      "title": "Developing Affectionate Love: Warm, Close, Friendly",
      "content": [
        "Affectionate love is the fourth stage in the development of bodhichitta. Geshe-la uses three words to describe it: warm, close, friendly. Each has a slightly different connotation — warmth describes the quality of the mind, closeness is an intimate and tender feeling of being at ease, and friendliness is being congenial, delighted to see someone.",
        "KK clarified the relationship between equanimity and affectionate love: equanimity is the first step — the basic level of warm, close, friendly that comes from letting go of anger, attachment, and indifference. Then viewing all beings as mother upgrades it further. Then remembering their kindness, and wanting to repay it, increases it further still. This stage is like the crystallized maximum version — the full effect of all those prior causes.",
        "The previous four stages are like causes; this stage is the effect. That's why it's drawn out separately."
      ],
      "quote": "So it's nice just to use this little checklist. Warm, close, friendly. What's it like to be warm towards this person, what's it like to be close to them, what's it like to be friendly with them?"

      "title": "Developing Great Compassion: A Love Issue, Not a Compassion Issue",
      "content": [
        "Great compassion wishes every being to be free from all suffering — not just temporary suffering, but samsara itself. The Buddhist view always encompasses future lives. If compassion doesn't arise easily, work backwards: the issue is in affectionate love. If affectionate love isn't working, check the stage before that. You can always diagnose the issue by stepping back one stage at a time.",
        "KK used the analogy of yogurt and milk. No milk, no yogurt. Compassion only develops on the basis of love. There's no shortcut. Most of our compassion issues are actually love issues. The only other issue is a renunciation issue.",
        "We must be vigilant about malice — delighting in anyone's downfall or bad news. It's on all sides of the political spectrum and it's the opposite of Buddhist thinking. Any influence that supports this way of thinking undermines our bodhichitta and our whole path."

      "quote": "Most of our compassion issues are love issues. There's one other type: a renunciation issue. It's never actually a compassion issue."

      "title": "The Three Causes of Delusion and Guarding the Senses",
      "content": [
        "There are three causes of delusion: the karmic seed, the object, and inappropriate attention. Ultimately we need to remove the seeds. Until then, we work on inappropriate attention. But if something instantly stimulates delusion, we can temporarily remove the object.",
        "This is called guarding the doors of the senses. It's not weakness — it's creating space to gather strength, get wiser and more loving, so we can eventually engage from a place of strength. Either remove the object or change the inappropriate attention. Geshe-la calls this a supreme way to practice moral discipline."

      "title": "Renunciation as Joy: The Domino Chain",
      "content": [
        "Renunciation is non-attachment — not the absence of attachment, but a virtuous mental factor that actively opposes attachment. A baby has absence of attachment for alcohol; that's not non-attachment. Non-attachment is an incredibly happy mind — no feelings of 'I need to be different,' 'I wish things were like this.'",
        "KK described a domino chain: thinking about the sufferings of samsara → opposing attachment → wanting to leave samsara → putting effort into leaving → actually leaving → ending suffering forever. The first domino (thinking about suffering) is linked to the last (permanent freedom). A huge moment in our spiritual life is when we love thinking about the sufferings of samsara because of this output.",
        "If thinking about suffering feels depressing, that's attachment — Stockholm Syndrome for our prison. Check the three questions: Do I want to overcome attachment? Do I believe I can? Do I have a mental image of what freedom looks like?"
      ],
      "quote": "If we were just us, minus all the discontented thoughts in our life, we'd basically already be incredibly happy."

      "title": "The General Suffering of Uncertainty",
      "content": [
        "The six general sufferings pervade every realm: uncertainty, having no satisfaction, having to leave our body repeatedly, having to take rebirth repeatedly, losing status repeatedly, having no companionship.",
        "KK focused on uncertainty. In samsara, no condition is certain. High status turns into servitude, beauty changes like a flower in autumn, wealth is lost as if merely lent, life perishes like lightning. Friendships are unstable — it takes only a few words to destroy trust.",
        "The Shariputra fish story illustrates this: a father is reborn as the fish his son catches, the mother becomes the dog, the enemy becomes the child. With clairvoyance, Shariputra declared 'Some sorrow makes me laugh!' When you see this kind of karmic switching everywhere, the pretension and romance of samsara falls away."

      "content": [
        "Take uncertainty as a daily practice. Use the mantra 'this is going to change' or 'this is uncertain' and apply it to everything — the good, the bad, the neutral.",
        "When we stop expecting certainty, we feel lighter. Then we get interested in the long game: what skills will actually help me navigate uncertainty? Not money, not health, not property — a peaceful mind and virtues. That's the real investment.",
        "The more we stay with this truth, the more we realize our Dharma practice is the only reliable tool for navigating the uncertainty of samsara."
