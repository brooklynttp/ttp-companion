      "Notice that restraint counts: Not gossiping, not snapping back \u2014 these are virtuous actions too. Celebrate them!",
      "Student practice: Use an 'enemy spreadsheet' \u2014 list people you have aversion toward, write 3 good things about each.",
      "Student practice: Track your mind with tokens \u2014 count 'meat' thoughts (this life only) vs 'heart' thoughts (future lives)."
