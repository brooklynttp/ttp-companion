        "text": "Just feel inspiring blessings pour down. Remember that Buddha's blessings are like the sun.\n\nOur mind is like a room. Developing the mind of faith is like opening the vines and letting the sun in.\n\nJust use your faith to let Buddha's compassionate blessings into your heart. Then we can take one of the benefits of bodhicitta.\n\nWhatever moves our heart the most. Deeply admire and appreciate that benefit. For example, if we think about how bodhicitta can protect us from fear.\n\nWe can reflect on our pain of fear and anxiety that we experience. How troubling and bothersome it is. How frustrating it is to live in fear.\n\nHow it makes us inert and unable to help others.\n\nYou can think about the misery of living a fearful life.\n\nBodhicitta will be a complete cure for this. Just apply this same method to whatever benefit we choose. Just seeing the personal problems this benefit will solve.\n\nAnd all the beautiful things that it will bring.\n\nOnce we develop some admiring faith in bodhicitta.\n\nWe allow this to then transform into wishing faith. Thinking, I want to develop a precious mind of bodhicitta.\n\nAnd hold that wish in meditation, single pointedly. If we get distracted, just return back to one of these benefits.\n\nReally admiring it.\n\nEspecially how it relates to you and what you need in your practice.\n\nWhen you get this sense of appreciation, seeing its beauty. Then transform your mind into wishing faith. Wishing to develop bodhicitta.\n\nAnd again concentrate on this wish, single pointedly.\n\nAnd let this wish to develop bodhicitta can gradually arise from our practice."

        "text": "So the practice was the setting the bodhicitta intention and relaxing was the one I was doing. And I was like really into this because my practice is very neurotic. So I was like really, really into this practice.\n\nSo I really got into it. It was very fruitful. And it was great because, hey, I was setting the bodhicitta intention, which is the superior intention, all week.\n\nThat's awesome. But it really didn't feel relaxed. And for the sake of time, I don't want to go through all the examples.\n\nI kind of want to give the conclusions and hear your response. So there's like three main reasons it didn't seem relaxed. Okay.\n\nSo the first one is that it's not like you set an intention. It's like you have to set your intention constantly. It's like I could set my intention.\n\nAnd because I was mindful of it this week, I was like, I have to set my intention. And like five minutes later, my intention has gone out the window. It's not just self-cherishing or whatever.\n\nRight? So it's like a vigilance. Doing bodhicitta is like a vigilant practice.\n\nLike it made me think of Bengungyo. So that's one thing. There's like vigilance to it.\n\nThe second thing is that when I tried to set my intention, and it was like, okay, I set my intention and relax. And like it's, sorry, like when I'm setting my intention, the energy of bodhicitta, it's like the word aspiring, engaging, are like, it's like a very active thing. And we talk about like fuel, like compassion and bodhicitta can fuel.\n\nSo it's a very high energy enterprise, which was again, a good thing. Right? Like I'm glad that I was pushed to be doing things.\n\nSo anyways, that was my experience of it. And the third thing was that when I was like setting the intention and then being like, let's see how it plays out. I can get into that for some things.\n\nRight? Like when it's like, oh, like I have people over for dinner. Oh, I'm setting my intention to cook you a nice meal.\n\nHey, I burned the food. Like that doesn't really matter. Right?\n\nBut it's like, this is everything. This is literally the purpose and meaning of my life. Right?\n\nAnd so for like that to like not work out, it's just so important. Right? And so to be relaxed about something so important, it just really didn't feel right.\n\nSo I know that's a lot. So I don't want to like, if you're going to just like pick one or whatever, but those were sort of like my three. It overall was good practice, but those were three experiences I have that were very unrelaxed."

        "text": "Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nAnd here, maybe even just the word relaxed in this context just has some sort of loaded connotation, because I think the way you interpret it is very different from the way that I interpret it. It seems like in your mind has something to do with like passivity and not having a lot of energy and not being vigilant, like almost just like stoned on a couch. That's not what I mean by relaxed.\n\nIt means you're just deeply peaceful. That's what I meant. Like you're just so peaceful in your heart.\n\nSo you can be totally vigilant and totally peaceful. You can be totally engaged and energetic and totally peaceful. Yeah.\n\nSo that's just sort of the connotation. And so it might be an interesting activity to think like, can I envision a relaxed vigilance or a relaxed activity or a relaxed energetic quality? Can I envision what that's like?\n\nAnd maybe the word relaxed there just doesn't work for the job. Maybe the word peaceful is like a better word for the job."

        "text": "Yeah. I think the main thing there is seeing that unpeacefulness with respect to any output is always attachment. And so it's like we have to kind of label that over and over and over again.\n\nLike peacefulness is attachment. The worry is attachment. And like the more we kind of slap that label on those moments, the more we'll start to see that response is coming from a delusion.\n\nAnd what we'll start to see is there's a way to do our best, but not get a certain output that's obvious, but feel deeply peaceful. But it's not until we start to like really identify worry and these kind of responses as attachment that we can really do that well. Thanks.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Thanks.\n\nYeah. And these, yes."

And there were a couple examples this week, which I won't get into, but it was like I had a situation, I was walking into it, that was very identical to a situation the previous week, but I had this very different motivation for it and a completely different feeling during it. I felt so much happier.\n\nAnd what a difference in the outcome. Like, wow. Really astonishing.\n\nAnd what I'm thinking, I was just sitting here thinking about how, what a wonderful week I had. And I think this is one of these practices that I just want to make part of who I am. Just like something that I do unconsciously all the time.\n\nSo I think I'm going to make it one of my six, maybe four of my six sessions, just because we don't have TT for a few weeks. I can really, especially visiting my family for Christmas, it'd be wonderful to have this all through like the next two weeks. So I think that's going to be my plan."

So it's kind of the intention to be part of the six session practice anyway.\n\nSo it's nice that kind of naturally you're attracted to it. Could you just say a little bit more though about, because again, like with the data, it's really helpful to say like why it worked. So like you said, you had these two situations, same thing, back to back weeks."

        "text": "Hi. Hi. Okay.\n\nSo what I tried, what I've been trying for the past couple of weeks is focusing on practicing patience in very minor, low stakes situations. Okay. So this week I had to go to the dentist and I had to get like 500 x-rays, you know, when they put the thing in your mouth and all these different ways.\n\nAnd I'm like, how could this be? This is just like one millimeter. Why do they need this angle?\n\nWhatever. And I usually really don't like it. And I thought, okay, I'm going to generate bodhichitta.\n\nI'm going to work on bodhichitta. It's going to take 45 minutes to clean my mouth. 45 minutes of bodhichitta.\n\nThis is going to be great. And especially with the x-rays because I usually have this gag reflex. And I was like, this is my job.\n\nIt's just to accept. And I felt so happy that I was like almost a little disappointed when the x-rays ended. I was like, what?\n\nThat's it? I want more. So, I'm really, I have a lot of like kind of things on fire that feel very high stakes and kind of almost too triggering for me to practice in a relaxed way.\n\nI'm practicing more in an intellectual way. So I'm finding that the low stakes stuff is where I can really like feel bodhichitta. And I'm like thinking about what you said a couple weeks ago about how it has to be 100%.\n\nLike, non-bodhichitta will win. So it's like 51%. I don't really know the math, but basically, it has to be 100% bodhichitta.\n\nIf there's like a little bit of non-virtue, like it doesn't, like the non-virtue will always win over bodhichitta. So, in those like small stakes moments, I can just like relax and just have it, have a whole mind of bodhichitta. Whereas, if I'm on the subway I'm like, oh, but the good thing is like, if I'm in the other trickier situations, I'm like, oh, I don't have 100% bodhichitta.\n\nThat's okay, but it's been helpful to be like, oh, I'm judging that person's outfit so I can have bodhichitta right now. But not trying, just like observing."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Kadam Kyle",
        "time": "47:15",
        "text": "Thanks. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, no, I appreciate what you're sharing here, Joanna, about like practicing in these seemingly low stakes situations.\n\nBecause, yeah, what I've personally found is very similar to kind of what you're describing, which is there are certain situations that are really hard to practice specific dharma techniques in. but usually because those are the most difficult things in our life, those are the things that we're slapping our dharma techniques against. And then we go on autopilot in the easier times, because we're like, pff, this is nothing.\n\nAnd even in nice times like going for a walk, or just going shopping, or hanging out with friends, or relaxing a little bit. And so it's like we pull out the dharma tools in the fires of our day, but then like in all these moments of relative calm and tranquility we kind of put them down. And it really is often like the opposite is probably the better tool, which is do it in those times of relative calm and tranquility and even nice moments.\n\nBecause that's actually where we get a lot of feeling for them. And we build up like a reservoir of peace. That then allows us to actually navigate those fires of life.\n\nAnd so for example, whenever I teach on patience, I often say to people patience is a mind that wholeheartedly accepts whatever is arising, having given up the idea that things are other than they are. So like when you walked down the street to the Dharma Center, which is a relatively low-stake experience, you're just walking down the street to the Dharma Center. It's actually a nice moment in the week, probably.\n\nLike were you wholeheartedly accepting the way things are, having given up the idea that they should be other? Right? Or was there a thought like ugh, it's a little cold.\n\nUgh, why didn't they shovel the sidewalk over here at the Salvation Army? You know? Why didn't they do that?\n\nThey left all the ice there. Or ugh, it's turned red, the light. I'm going to have to wait.\n\nYou know? Just these little thoughts. And like even though they're really low-stakes, they're actually moments of non-acceptance.\n\nEvery single one of them, right? So it's like are we actually practicing wholeheartedly happily accepting every single one of these little moments? And if not, fantastic.\n\nThat's a great area to practice with. That's not a small thing because we're not even doing it. It's actually not small.\n\nIt's big because it's not happening right now. That's actually our level of practice right now. And once we do it there, we start to feel inspired.\n\nWe feel whole. We just feel like full. And then when those fires hit, we got something to call on.\n\nSo anyway, I'm just sharing a sort of agreement with this kind of way of practicing. Thank you. Others, please?\n\nDavid, yes?"

        "text": "This is a little similar to Adriana's, but the method for getting there was the practice of seeing things as a gift. I guess you use the word gift. I use it more as the word test.\n\nBasically, seeing everything that happens to me is like a test for my mind. And when I remember to do it, it was amazing. So many times, I'd just be upset about something, usually kind of low-stakes things, maybe something at work.\n\nSomebody said they were going to do something and didn't do it. And then all of a sudden, I remember, wait, maybe this is one of those tests. And all of a sudden, it's like no problem at all.\n\nSo just trying to remember to do that is like a massive patience exercise. Maybe I like turning into a little bit of a game or something like that. All of a sudden, it's like how virtuous, how much can I accept this situation?\n\nThere's a little bit of a purification, I think, that happens too. You accept something that you wouldn't have previously accepted. It's like all this negativity in my mind somewhere, and I feel like when I accept it, it's like putting out this little fire someplace.\n\nIt feels really nice."

Let me see if I can pass this test, dealing with this annoying person or this challenging situation or whatever. And it just makes it a lot more fun and jovial.\n\nYeah, you're right.

This is Geshe-la's call. How do I act?\n\nAnd so I decided I'm just not going to react. I'm not going to react to this anger. I'm just not.\n\nAnd I shut it down and I actually blocked this person. And I just said, well, I'm just going to pray. I'm just going to pray for them and process it differently.\n\nBut I think the message for me was like Geshe-la or the guru just saying you have attachment in this particular area and these are the last vestiges of this attachment. So how are you going to deal with this mean, you know? And I was like, yes, I'm ripping it apart.\n\nThat's it. Cut, cut, cut. I'm so happy.\n\nBut I don't think this week I'm going to do that practice. I'm going to take a little break. I'm going to decide on something else.\n\nThat's my report."

Yeah, that's great, Mimi.\n\nI think it's lovely. I know what you mean in these situations. Sometimes something has to just completely blow up for us to just let it go.\n\nAnd that's often actually a good gift because our attachment or whatever is like holding on and kind of greedily holding on even though the whole thing is burning down. And we're just like, no, I don't want to let go. And then it just absolutely blows up.\n\nAnd then it just allows us, it's kind of painful, right, but it's a gift because we just drop it and then we're free. And on the other side we feel some relief. Sometimes it's worth it to just blow it up.\n\nDon't purposely blow it up, but if it does blow up, let it blow up and drop it. Yeah.

        "text": "So my ongoing six-week succession practice has been, was really great this week. I'm just becoming more and more just remembering to rely on my spiritual guide. Every issue I have.\n\nSo the benefit that I was really focusing on this week was the power of protection from fear because I'm a very fearful person and it really holds me back in a lot of ways. And I've been saying this prayer to Geshe-la for weeks now, six times a day. And it's been so helpful and realizing that the fear is self-cherishing and that it's a state of mind.\n\nAnd just, so what I've been doing whenever I feel anything, any anxiety arising or any fear, just asking for blessings to Geshe-la to please bless me to do whatever I have to do to not feel this way, to remember that it's self-cherishing. And this past week during an acupuncture session, I had a little visitation as the same as if in a dream from my mother. And I've been working on some, thinking about things a lot about how my mother impacted my life and why, trying to explain why I'm the way I am because of things that my mother did.\n\nAnd I had a conversation with her about certain things and a lot was resolved in that. And I believe it was a blessing from my spiritual guide. And at the end of this little visitation, if you will, my mother became Tara and Vajrayogini and Prajnaparamita.\n\nAnd I was like, oh, that's right. They're all the same nature. My mother is the same nature as Tara and Tara's here protecting me.\n\nSo I have to stop just sort of like making excuses for my behavior because of something my mother did 30 years ago or 40 years ago or 50 years ago. And it was such a blessing from my spiritual guide that I just, I walked through, I've said this once before, I walk through life now just feeling as if he's with me all the time. When we first started the six-session practice, you had, Kadamkhal, you had said that it was something that was going to change our lives or change our practice or change our lives.\n\nAnd it really has done that for me.

        "text": "Okay, very good. Let's take a look at the text. And just a reminder, so we're not here next Sunday, and the Sunday after that.\n\nSo we'll be off for two weeks. So maybe something that we can focus on in the second class today is a bit about wrapping up the year spiritually. Because it's nice to bookend things.\n\nAnd like reflect a little bit on what we learned about ourself and our practice from the year. And how we kind of want to integrate that going forward. Because we always want to be kind of practicing at the cutting edge of our practice, right?\n\nThe cutting edge of our practice isn't always the cutting edge of where it's always been. It's where it is today, right? That's the cutting edge of our practice.\n\nThat's where we want to be. We don't want to be in an abstracted place like over here, in some sort of theoretical world, when maybe the delusions we're facing are like right here. There are certain delusions, certain problems we're dealing with, certain challenges we're dealing with.\n\nThat's where we want to be practicing, right? And so it's very useful to kind of do these semi-regular check-ins. We try to do it every day if possible, at night time.\n\nBut if you can't do it every day at night time, then doing it somewhat regularly. To just see, okay, what was sort of like some highs, what were the spiritual highs of this year? What were some lows from the year?\n\nAnd then, what did I learn about myself this year? What are the lessons I learned about myself and my practice this year? And where am I at right now?\n\nAnd what's going to be that next step for me, based on where I'm at right now? It's just a sort of interesting thing with Dharma, because it's so interesting and evocative, it is very easy to just enjoy thinking about it, pondering it, but not necessarily looking at our specific delusions that are causing us problems right now, today, with the people in our life. And it's just an interesting thing, because not everything is like that, but it's interesting enough to engage us like that.\n\nBut we all love Dharma, and it's actually possible for our practice to be a bit like this, where we're thinking about it, but then at the same time, the delusions that we have on a day-to-day basis aren't getting looked at. I like to write some little Dharma thoughts each day, just as a way for me to contemplate in an organized way, and kind of make sure it happens each day. And what I try to catch for myself is, when am I talking about pondering something totally theoretical, versus my actual delusions that are occurring that day.\n\nGoing, meh, meh, meh, they did this. Meh, meh, meh, I did that. It's like, okay, now I'm talking about some theoretical thing, or pondering some theoretical thing, but I'm not looking at this whining mind that I have, which is actually what I'm dealing with, my whining mind, my critical mind of other people, my judgmental mind, my attached mind, right?\n\nAnd for me, it's just very helpful to say, oh, that's actually the cutting edge of my practice for today. That's actually where I'm at. That's where I want to be digging in.\n\nAnyway, sorry, this is for the next class. After the break, we'll kind of talk about this in more detail. But the main thing is, what did we learn about ourself from this year?\n\nMaybe some highs, some lows, spiritually. And then, where are we at today? And what's that next step for our practice, like tomorrow, right, for us?\n\nOkay. So page 28, starting with the paragraph, if we are to engage. Sukesha says here, if we're to engage in the actual development of bodhicitta, we need strong inspiration.\n\nAnd this is only acquired by reflecting on the many benefits of this mind, of bodhicitta. If we knew of a king who had great wealth, power, and knowledge, we might easily think, how wonderful it would be to become like him. Such a desire arises only because we have seen the good qualities that king possesses, and therefore we wish to emulate him.\n\nSimilarly, first we must understand the good qualities of bodhicitta, and only then will the thought arise how wonderful it would be to give birth to such a precious mind. At present, however, if someone were to ask us which we would prefer, to develop bodhicitta, or possess a nugget of gold, I'm talking a big nugget, not a wimpy little nugget, you know, enough that it would interest us, you know, we would go to the cash for gold place, you know, and we'd already be planning it out, right, ready to bring our nugget there. We would certainly choose the gold.\n\nWe're like, no I wouldn't, I'm on TTP. I wouldn't choose the gold. Okay, what do you think about all day?\n\nRight, if someone looked at your thoughts all day, how many of them have to do with your, like, occupation and making money? And how many of them have to do with developing bodhicitta purposely? And if it's not gold, it might be being liked, it might be some pleasure, it might be, yeah, some pleasure, yeah.\n\nSome, yeah, like reputation, praise, whatever the thing is, yeah. So, it's just helpful to see, like, if someone actually looked at the download of our thoughts from the day, like a document with all of our thoughts, would they say, like if they looked at Kyle's thoughts for the day, they say, is Kyle more interested in gold or bodhicitta? Right?\n\nAnd then they would look. They'd tally up the thoughts. How many thoughts were about scheming to grow my bodhicitta today?\n\nAnd how many thoughts were scheming to grow maybe one of the eight worldly concerns? Right? And just check, right?\n\nSo we just ask ourselves, what's going on in our mind, you know, for real? This is because we see the valuable qualities of gold, but fail to see the incomparable qualities and benefits of bodhicitta. If we understand these benefits, our choice would be different.\n\nWe would realize that while gold is easily obtained, no amount of money in the world can buy bodhicitta, something not found for sale anywhere. The only way to obtain the precious bodhicitta is to develop it ourself through long meditation. Until we develop a continuous and spontaneous aspiration to develop bodhicitta, we should spend much time contemplating its benefits in general.\n\nFrom Shantideva's list of ten benefits, we should select the one that has the strongest positive influence on our mind and meditate reflectively upon it. For such a meditation to be of greatest value, it should be continuous and concentrated. Then at the close...\n\nOops, sorry. For such a meditation to be of greatest value, it should be continuous and concentrated. Okay, so...\n\nHas anyone memorized the ten benefits of bodhicitta? Okay, we got Adriana's hand was up first, I think. Yeah.\n\nDo you actually want to share them or no? You don't have to. Okay, let's chuck her the mic.\n\nYeah, yeah."

        "text": "Much more important, the fact that the Salvation Army people don't clean their ice. Yes. Thank you.\n\nThanks, Ryan, for being a good sport. Okay. Then, at the close of the meditation session, we should repeat the prayer originally cited in the introduction to this commentary.\n\nMay the precious Supreme Bodhicitta grow where it has not yet grown. Where it has grown, may it not decrease, but flourish forevermore. By reciting this prayer, we're stating our desire to give birth to Bodhicitta as quickly as possible.\n\nWe can recite this prayer after performing any virtuous action. We should remember that without Bodhicitta, whatever powers we may have and whatever miracles we may be able to perform are of no real benefit. Being able to fly in the sky is of no importance.\n\nEven birds are able to do this. Would you rather fly in the sky or have Bodhicitta? We've had such miracle powers and clairvoyance many times in our previous lives, but what have they done for us?\n\nNow is the time to control our untamed mind with Bodhicitta. With Bodhicitta, the mind is made peaceful. Enlightenment and fulfillment of all our wishes are not very far away.\n\nIt is important to remember that we cannot attain enlightenment if we do not first acquaint ourselves with and then master the methods for developing Bodhicitta. We must practice these methods as diligently as possible, all the while exhorting ourselves to generate this precious attitude. Nowadays, with the world in turmoil, there's a particular need for Westerners to cultivate Bodhicitta, a.k.a. everyone. If we're to make it through these perilous times, true Bodhisattvas must appear in the West as well as in the East. Okay, so this feeling that we're trying to develop here is this powerful desire to grow our Bodhicitta mind. So when we're thinking about this, we're trying to figure out what are my specific obstacles to its cultivation.\n\nFor me, what are my exact obstacles? This is a good thing to do with any Lamrim meditation, or any meditation in general, and it's something we always want to do when we're teaching Dharma, is to think what are the obstacles for the people who are coming to the class about understanding this. What are their obstacles?\n\nBecause from one point of view, if we fully appreciated Bodhicitta, and we didn't have obstacles to its development, we would just develop it now. We'd just do it, because it's the most no-brainer thing to do. You're just done with samsara, you'll be enlightened in no time, you'll forever be happy, you'll be able to actually help your friends and family, you'll actually be able to make a difference in the world.\n\nIt's the most no-brainer thing in the world. It's just so obviously a good idea. But we're not doing it, right?\n\nIf we're still in samsara, we're not doing it. So there's an obstacle, or two, or ten, or whatever. And so we want to figure these out, what these are for us.\n\nSo there's lots of different obstacles that could be. Generally, we kind of want to start with things like faith, around faith. So it could be like a believing faith issue in bodhicitta, like we don't believe in it.\n\nThat could be we don't believe in bodhicitta, specifically, or we don't believe in enlightenment. Or we just only somewhat believe in enlightenment. So there could be like a believing faith issue.\n\nThere could be more of an admiring faith issue, like we're not that interested in it. If there was a course on tantra, if there was a course on emptiness, we'd go, ooh, yeah. If there's a course on bodhicitta, no.\n\nNot interested, thank you very much. Got other things going on. So do we admire bodhicitta in the same way we admire other dharma realizations?\n\nOr is it just simply like not much of a wish? Maybe we think, yeah, agreed. Good idea.\n\nYeah, I kind of believe in it. Yeah. But there's just not a powerful desire to cultivate it.\n\nSo we can always start there, right? Whenever we're looking at our obstacles, we can kind of go through three types of faith and see, is there this? Is there that?\n\nIs there this? Is there that? So that's like one bit.\n\nThen, we can kind of go into effort next. So with effort, we can go to the different types of laziness and just check, are these there? So there's the laziness of discouragement.\n\nThis is the most classic one. Basically, we don't feel we could change or we feel something is too high for us or things haven't been going well in our practice or we think that we're stuck in some way or something just doesn't work anymore or it's like a discouragement about like the Buddhas and their ability to help us or even in the truth of what they teach or even discouragement around our Sangha or our spiritual guide. So there's all sorts of permutations on discouragement.\n\nThere's also procrastination, which is like, I'll do it later. I've got more important things to do right now. Thank you.\n\nI can't deal with bodhicitta. I've got to work. I've got to make some cash.\n\nI've got to deal with this area of my life. Or I've got to do other practices. I've got to do other activities and then I'll get around to the bodhicitta.\n\nSo there's procrastination. Then there's being attached to what's meaningless and non-virtuous, which is basically, I just think other things are more interesting, frankly. I just like other stuff more.\n\nI just like other things more than bodhicitta. I like TV more. I like hanging out with my friends more.\n\nI like, you know, going to this activity more. You know, whatever. I like, who knows what, more.\n\nSo it's a laziness, right? Because it basically makes things that are not those activities seem unpleasant. Because they're getting in the way of the fun parts of our life.\n\nSo they're burdensome. Ugh, Jeff. Jeff's got to generate bodhicitta.\n\nUgh, I've got to go to class. Ugh, it's getting in the way of all the fun things I'm doing as I lock myself into my little prison cell for millions of more lives. And samsara.\n\nI'm having so much fun doing this. Can't be bothered. Anyway, that's laziness of being attached to what's meaningless and non-virtuous.\n\nAnd then the laziness of indolence, which is just like being attached to immobility and sleep and inactivity. Obviously we need sleep, need rest. We can become so preferential towards it that we just don't want to do anything particularly.\n\nIndolence, yeah. So it's helpful, right? You just take your practice of developing bodhicitta and just run from the lazinesses.\n\nOkay, laziness of discouragement. Where are you? Okay, you're here, you're there.\n\nOkay, I know you with this, I know you with that. Great. Got that obstacle down.\n\nRight, laziness of procrastination. Putting it off, et cetera. Okay, good, got you.\n\nLaziness of being attracted to what's meaningless and non-virtuous. Okay, that's how that functions. Laziness of indolence, okay, that's how that functions.\n\nSo we're just kind of seeing the different obstacles at play here. So we can always go to the faith challenges. We can always go to the effort-based difficulties and challenges.\n\nThen there's just a couple other little bits and pieces. That are worth looking at. One is just simple distraction.\n\nAnd the issue with distraction is it just makes all Dharma uninteresting. Like Dharma loses its magic and its luster if we're in a very distracted state. And it's just simply that our mind can't absorb long enough to taste the magic.\n\nAnd this is just, it's a very tricky thing to break out of, right? Because our mind is so busy and rapid and constantly wandering towards delusions. That even just sitting down and being quiet it's just being locked up like with a madman.\n\nWith just like rapid, deluded thoughts. Sitting down to meditate is that. This is not fun at first, right?\n\nIt's just, ugh, I don't want to do that. Sounds like the worst idea ever. I need to be busy.\n\nI need to have people to hang out with. I need things to do. I don't want to be hanging out with my delusions all day.\n\nIt's so painful. It is. So it's quite a tricky trap to kind of break out of, right?\n\nAnd usually what happens is that in a distracted mindset our mind becomes sort of so agitated and unhappy that it feels that the only way to escape is more distraction. So there's like a sort of self reinforcing effect of this. Which is like my mind's in pain.\n\nIt's so agitated and distracted. Ah! Okay, sitting alone with that.\n\nNo way! That's too painful. More distraction?\n\nOh, that actually feels good because now I'm not facing it. Phew! I'm on the hedonic treadmill.\n\nI'm like going, going, going. I've got this going on. I've got that going on.\n\nGreat! I'm not facing the pain of it. Right?\n\nSo we've just got to keep upping the dose until catastrophe. There's only one way that one goes. Which is down hard.\n\nSo anyway, we can check like what degree of maybe our obstacle in our bodhicitta or any lamrim meditation. It's just simple distraction. We've gotten stuck in a distracting loop in our life around distracting habits.\n\nOf course the devices are the biggest culprit but there's other things too that are related here. So we can kind of check there. There's that obstacle.\n\nAnyway, we can kind of keep going on forever about this but the last one for now is just our renunciation obstacle. Because bodhicitta basically is like renunciation for others. It's kind of like that.\n\nIt's just like having renunciation on behalf of others. And we can only have renunciation on behalf of others if we have renunciation sort of on behalf of ourselves. There's lots of different reasons for this.\n\nOne is that we actually see the clear solution when we have proper renunciation. And this gives us the clear solution for others. But if we don't understand precisely how others become liberated from suffering, then our bodhicitta is always going to be lacking power and vision.\n\nIt's going to be missing the part, the answer. And usually it's because we think we're somehow liberating inherently existent living beings. Which is an impossible task.\n\nSo it's a renunciation that actually gives us the insight into our own liberation. And once we realize that, we realize it's realizing emptiness. That's liberation.\n\nThere was no inherent person ever in the first place. Then we realize, oh, my bodhicitta isn't about liberating inherent people. There are no inherent people.\n\nOh. It's about liberating mere named people. That's a very different operation.\n\nIt's a much easier operation to liberate mere named people. Anyway, as we develop proper renunciation, it informs the bodhicitta. This is one aspect of it.\n\nThe other is just that it gives us the kind of drive and the power. Because we just find samsara completely repulsive and uninteresting. And we feel this on behalf of others.\n\nSo they're going through that. But there are huge stakes. There are huge stakes.\n\nThis is kind of like, I think, part of Sumit's point earlier. There are huge stakes for others in our practice. And we do care.\n\nAnd we should care. And so, the more we see the stakes for ourselves, which comes from our renunciation and contemplating specifically the seven sufferings of human life, birth, sickness, aging, and death, encountering what we don't like, being separate from what we do like, and failing to satisfy our desires. Once we see the stakes for ourselves, then, of course, we'll see the stakes for others.\n\nAnd that will give us the drive there. So, the point is, sometimes a bodhicitta issue is just a renunciation issue. There's a renunciation deficiency there.\n\nAnd all we've got to do is up our renunciation game a little bit. So this is just an example of how you would go through identifying obstacles. And what's important about this activity is that if we just take a meditation and we're hammering at it, which means just doing the meditation a lot, but it's not going anywhere, it's much more skillful to identify what are the obstacles at play.\n\nLet me undo the obstacles and then when I revisit the meditation, it might just be easy and simple. It's sort of like meditation is less like an amazing, beautiful jewel. And the obstacle is this concrete barrier that's been fused around it.\n\nAnd we're trying to grab that jewel and we're just blooding our hand on that concrete barrier. And we don't realize, oh, there's just this huge obstacle in my mind. Oh, I just have to break the obstacle.\n\nBut if we're just trying to let go for the jewel without cracking open that obstacle, it can end up just being very frustrating. And our practice can become something that's just really frustrating and upsetting even. And that's such a disappointment because we worked so hard to build it up.\n\nWe don't want it to get into those spaces. This is just an exercise that we can do with any meditation, but I'm just trying to illustrate it with respect to bodhichitta."

Okay. You know?\n\nI'm not trying to point out where I'm a bad person or doing something wrong. It's just like, this is what's in the refrigerator. And that's really hard.\n\nIf I don't do it that way, I'm not going to even admit what the obstacles are. It's really tricky."

Part of our practice is getting really skilled at doing this and being able to see our obstacles totally objectively but without the tiniest bit of self reproach.\n\nNot even the tiniest bit. Maximum kindness to oneself and maximum honesty. And that's a really sweet spot to be in.\n\nBut it's just a bit tricky. Because we have a lot of psychological defense mechanisms against seeing the truth in our mind for different reasons. And sometimes maybe that's the obstacle.\n\nThat's a whole other bag of worms that we can investigate. yeah, learning how to do that is really, really important. Not that long ago, I had this dream night after night after night of these different people I've harmed in my life.\n\nThis is a very strange thing. Each night I had a new dream of another person I had harmed in my life. And at somewhere around the fifth or sixth night of it, I was like, oh my god, I'm having this weird purification thing going on.\n\nOf how I actually fully purified. And they were people from a long time ago. But they actually purified that karma around this person and that person.\n\nIt was interesting because not exactly. I spent a lot of time doing purification practice. It was a humbling moment for me.\n\nEven though I'm really trying. Really trying to purify my negative karma and be honest about my delusions and my problems and this and that. I'm really giving my all.\n\nStill, there are these people, especially from my childhood and so on. It's like, I've harmed, but I haven't actually purified that yet. So why not?\n\nWhy haven't I been honest with myself about that? What am I trying to hide from? And it just was very touching to see that.\n\nIt was humbling too. I have a long way to go. For some reason my mind can't even look at that right now.\n\nI have since purified that. But I'm sure there are other things that will keep coming up over time. Anyway, just to conclude, we want to have this skill of being maximally self-honest and maximally gentle.\n\noften, once we fully inhabit that, more little truths bubble up in our mind. It was almost like our mind wasn't letting us see those things because it was afraid of the self-reproach that would set in. So we're actually able to really start to look at all those little bits and pieces at that point.\n\nAnyway, that's good. Marianne, last thing, and then we'll take a breather."

Oh, that is better, but now it's a little tart, and I don't want to, okay, what's going to balance the tartness?\n\nYou know, and there's like this balancing act, and it's the same with actually most of our lamrim meditations and our relationship with our different meditations. It's like you're trying to balance a recipe. You get in the right mix, and there's a sort of like cocktail or like set of ingredients of mental factors and mindsets inside of us, and usually they're a little bit out of whack, and we have to adjust them, and as we kind of adjust one, it goes a little too high over here, and then something else goes a bit low, and then you've got to adjust that, and then this one goes a little bit low, and you just tinker with it, and if we treat it as a fun game, then it's a delight, or like a little puzzle, then it's a delight. If we treat it as a burden, and in an angsty and frustrated way, then it's incredibly annoying to do this.\n\nAnd so, we just have to kind of learn how to balance our mind in this way, and this is a big part of dharma practice, like knowing what, like how we're unbalanced right now, and what we're going to do to rebalance, and we might try that out, and it might actually tilt us a little bit too far, and then we have to have maybe a third thing, right, that sends us slightly the other direction, and as we build out our dharma tools, our arsenal, our ingredients, whatever the analogy is, then we're able to kind of like figure out how to do this quite skillfully. Anyway, thank you. Okay, so in the next class, we'll start off with a meditation, just pondering, okay, what are the obstacles for me to developing bodhicitta?\n\nAnd we'll just spend five minutes pondering that. If you want to talk about it, or discuss it in the break, that's great too. And then we'll spend a little bit of time on, like a little bit in the text, but then we'll talk about sort of an end-of-year investigation.\n\nAlright, I think that's it. Just a reminder, two things. 24th, there's an afternoon with the Buddha of Compassion and Adriana.\n\nSo it should be a fun time here. So if you want to do something Christmas Eve, 24th, whatever, come along. It should be a very meaningful time.\n\nAnd four, is it four? Two to four. Okay, sorry, two to four.\n\nAnd then New Year's Eve, we'll be here. This year we have live music. Very exciting.\n\nWe're upping our game. One of our Dharma music. If you see it as Dharma, then everything is Dharma music.\n\nOkay. Yeah, with Fred, he's one of our FP members, but anyone who's above average musically is welcome to join. Which I think is self-selecting, because you probably won't offer if it's going to be terrifying for everyone.\n\nNo, I'm just kidding. Anyone who wants to join. He said he could make it work for anyone.\n\nSo, come along. That's seven to nine New Year's Eve. Let's dedicate and then we'll come back at 6.15. Okay, we can think to the virtues we've collected through practicing, meditating, discussing. May all living beings find lasting peace of mind, enlightenment."

Like, ah, that's what's kind of in my way right now. That's it.\n\nIf you don't get that feeling, then there's other maybe sneakier things going on other than the main culprits. other than the main culprits. Pride is one of them.\n\nBecause pride functions a bit like an invisible barrier. It's quite invisible. Because it's so closely related to self-grasping and self-cherishing.\n\nYou can almost think of it as indistinguishable from self-grasping in some ways. from self-grasping in some ways. So, there's kind of an invisible quality to pride.\n\nSo, there's kind of an invisible quality to pride. So, if you did the exercise and you had this feeling of like, I looked through the obstacles, it just doesn't feel like one resonates with me. it just doesn't feel like one resonates with me.\n\nPride's a good target then. Pride's a good target then. Because it's a sense of like, well, part of the reason that we can't find any culprit is because it would be too painful for our pride to find a culprit.\n\nOr, how could we have an obstacle? Or, how could we have an obstacle? Because we're the best.\n\nOr, who's Buddha to say, I have an obstacle. I'm justified in everything I'm doing and feeling. I'm justified in everything I'm doing and feeling.\n\nThese are all different permutations of pride. Pride's definitely an inverse of faith. they're often kind of faith-related issues, but some of them can be a bit subtle.\n\nbut some of them can be a bit subtle. And often it's because of the pride involved in it. So, that would be like an example of a culprit So, that would be like an example of a culprit that is worth looking at if you kind of did the exercise and nothing touched your heart and go hmm what's the role that deluded pride plays in my in my practice and that would be an example of one but sometimes we have to do other little poking around okay all right guess who says here to develop bodhicitta we must complete four preparations it's very important to know these because if we prepare well it is easy to develop bodhicitta thus we should thus we should one acquaint our mind with the benefits of bodhicitta to accumulate a wealth of merit three purify ourself of all non-virtue all now that's it okay and for understand the method for developing bodhicitta the last point will be discussed in the next section in this commentary okay so we have other little culprits here these are also invisible ones right number two and three merit lack and then for number three is just negative karma then the negative karma obstacle is that the specific tricky iteration of it is the negative karma from holding wrong views okay if you've read Geshe-la's explanation of the short Vajrasattva practice and or instructions on Mahamudra or looked at any of his teachings on Vajrasattva and purification from the last many years that where he's taught on it he's principally taught people to purify the imprints of holding wrong views the reason is because that imprint is much more complicated and problematic than for example the imprint to like get sick or something like this or just have misfortune befall you because like misfortune befalls us externally but we have no wrong views we just have Dharma minds we're just like bring it on baby you know gobble gobble more the merrier we're just we're winning right so the most problematic effect is the effect that comes from holding wrong views why is this because these are just views that have denied Dharma in a past life so why is this so problematic it leads to different effects one is that we just don't understand Dharma it doesn't make sense to us we're just like what are you talking about it makes no sense I had this experience when I first learned about Buddhism in a high school world history class and I remember learning about it thinking that's all wrong completely wrong and I'm feeling really clear like makes it no sense it's completely wrong and actually feeling surprised anyone believe it you know and it's part of the limitation of the teacher but part of it is just my wrong views but I just it looked like the most wrong thing I've ever heard about right and then just a couple years later reading a Buddhist book thinking everything in this is right this is the most self-evident amazing thing I've ever read you know and it's interesting like mind shift karma shifted but it's helpful for me to see to have both those experiences right to juxtapose them like when I was feeling that way in high school reading it I wasn't that that was my experience right this is just wrong it's just this is just not right but that's all it wasn't like a battle it wasn't like I was doubting it even right it just appeared completely false and so to see that disappear that view so helpful for me right to go wow my mind can completely view something in the wrong way especially with Dharma and so what happens is that from holding wrong views in past lives when we read Dharma it doesn't make sense to us and then or when we study and practice it doesn't make sense and then we do practice it we don't gain experience it just stays kind of distant and kind of far away we don't we don't see like it working for us so what Geshe-la has taught before is that of course we want to purify all of our negative karma but it's often effective to target our purification practice towards something because it gives it a little bit more power to make it specific and like aimed at some culprit and and aiming it at the negative karma from holding wrong views is a surefire way to do that it's like the way I think about it is okay I have all this karma from holding wrong views in past lives so then when I study Dharma sometimes basically all I'm doing is ripening that karma right so I'm like reading something so I'm putting in the sort of input of studying Dharma the output I'm getting is the karma of holding wrong views from the past which is not understanding this is annoying as heck it's so frustrating right we put in something we just keep ripening this karma of holding wrong views of course we can just think well it doesn't matter I'm just creating good karma I don't need to worry about it but that's a hard thing to hold if it keeps happening for days months years decades at some point we're gonna go sorry I'm done with that that's it you know no more thank you very much it's just that's a very frustrating experience right so as we if we target that negative karma in our mind then what happens is we just read a line we think we basically experience incredible blessings and it just touches our heart and it feels so beautiful and amazing you want to tell everyone it and that I've heard that line thank you much why are you so excited about that it's because we got a taste of it I'm sure we've all been there right to like revisit a Dharma teaching idea practice maybe years later or months later days later where where it clicked right and the sense of wow that was there all along Wow before it was just like a language I didn't understand and now it's alive and it's vivid it's it's incredible it's delectable okay so anyway the point there is that this is one of the invisible kind of obstacles right it's just having tons of negative karma from holding wrong views in the past and if for example like we notice ourself going mmm I'm not sure Buddha's right about this right that's a sign tendency similar to the cause of holding wrong views right so it's a sign right that there's obviously a ton of karma from holding wrong views still in our mind right just operating if we have the tendency to do it you know still one for you of course it's just a mind that a so the number just action so it's a nine that it's a mind that denies something that's necessary to attain liberation so you're out we're outright denying something that is necessary for attain liberation doesn't mean having a doubt that's not wrong view you have to deny"

purify the rest too okay so I just want to complete that a little bit there just again just to look at some more of these invisible obstacles so like negative karma such a negative karma of holding wrong views right okay so then about drawing some conclusions from the last year so one of the skills we want to get into is understanding sort of what phase our practice is in and you can use all sorts of different analogies but let's take the analogy of an airplane because Geshe does use this about like then you know bodhichitta conventional bodhichitta is like the runway and the practice of higher secret tantra is like the you know stealth bomber or whatever plane you want to use that flies off of that thing anyways we won't be unpacking that part of the analogy and this is helpful to use just like an idea of like a plane or something right so kind of misdiagnosing the sort of phase that our practice is in is a is a bit of a mistake because we don't take the correct actions that are necessary for moving us to the next step in our practice so think about like a plane and you're the pilot right and so maybe they're like like one of the stages is like simply kind of figuring out how to like run that plane right and it's like a scholastic phase you're not even necessarily doing that much but you're like collecting teachings ideas studying and this is a phase in our practice it doesn't even just mean at the beginning but they're like periods of time where we go through we realize there's a Dharma limitation in our knowledge and our scholarship there's like a lack actually and this will happen over and over in our practice and if we don't have this happen over and over in our practice we are missing something definitely right this our scholarship doesn't end until we're a Buddha so there are definite gaps in our scholarship part of is our experience at Dharma is our scholarship too right so this is like a phase right you're just sort of like it's like the pilot sort of like learning how to fly like reading the handbook how to work the plane and so on and this is like a that's a little bit like a still phase you know not necessarily tons of movement on the outside but it's sort of like recalibration retreats can be a little bit like this too something like that yeah then there's sort of like take off right and this is okay I'm starting to see positive movement here I haven't hit my full stride yet but I'm like moving in the right direction I'm like starting to hit a flow so early on in our practice this is like maybe come to classes for a while and and we're still kind of like sitting in the airplane reading the book you know and like figuring out what to do and then one day maybe we form a bit of a regular practice or we do something like heart tool and rim or join a study program or something we're like whoo yeah I'm like taking off here like I'm starting to like feel something and I'm starting to move somewhere spiritually this also can happen at points in our life where we've like slowed down a little bit and then we've kind of kicked it back into gear maybe after a break maybe after some time where we needed some rest maybe you just practice dissolved a little bit for whatever reason it's like liftoff then there's like kind of like we've hit the 30,000 plus you know feet we're just like soaring we're flying everything's good right and that's like okay I've really hit my stride here I've really hit where I want to go it doesn't last like that forever because usually there's a new learning that comes eventually but there are periods where we've really hit that stride and that's a time where we want to be we want to be building up like collecting virtue when we're in a space like that because that's going to protect us in the other phases it's like in it that's a really strong point where we're really clear we're energized we're focused whatever we want to gather in that point and then there's um there's various forms of like going down there's like a free fall I'm not laughing at it it's just laughing because I've been there and I know how unfun that is that's sometimes what happens right we're just like we just like lose the plot it's usually just some really strong delusions come up and they absolutely kick our butt and we weren't ready for him we didn't know they were gonna come and now we're falling and we're bracing you know for impact there's also like just kind of a like a slowly deflating fall a little bit different than the free fall it's just like we sort of like we were kind of cruising we thought everything was good we kind of forgot what got us there and then we just like took our hands off the off the plane you know and we're just actually that probably makes you free fall anyway but we're just like slowly deflating right and we haven't lost it completely right but we're like we're moving sort of in the wrong direction for our practice for happiness for well-being and then there's like a healthier version of it which is like a purposeful landing which is more like okay I could maintain that kind of like strength and power and that like altitude right but I have to like because of like life changes or things going on I have to actually like pause a little bit not like pause my practice but pause that level of intensity of practice and land you know refuel kind of check what my next step in life is and what my next stage is and that's like a purposeful kind of like it's kind of like when you reorganize your practice because you realize it wasn't exactly what we wanted to be it's not working maybe for the life situation we're in right now and we want to kind of rethink it and then lastly there's well the landing there is like the person picking up the book again so that that comes full circle and then lastly there's the when we free fall and exploded on the ground and that's a very helpful moment to notice and I think there's times where people are actually in that and they think they're one of the other sets and they're on fire like in a jet fuel is like you know melting their their skin off them anyway it's like it's all it's all absolutely blown up right and and that's that's kind of a moment right it can be basically the whole thing has gotten ruptured it could be like a certain attachment has taken over to such a degree that it's like cut off everything else it could be like to a partner or person or experience a job the pleasure and addiction whatever that could be a form of like a complete crash landing or it could just be more like some anger set in or some discouragement sudden it's just really taken hold to such a degree that was like the joy in our practice is just not there anymore right and it's just an analogy right but but it's just like a little framework to ponder sometimes and it's like it doesn't matter if we're at any of those stages in our practice and there's little many versions of this that can happen even in one day but it's helpful to kind of diagnose okay today today like this is sort of where I feel at and am I like in a sort of a recouping rebuilding stage am I just lifting off I'm kind of getting on the right track am I soaring you know coasting am I descending crap or um you know vertically down am I sort of like losing steam or am I kind of purposely kind of quieting things down so that I can like re-evaluate or have I full-on crash landed and I'm on fire so we can just kind of play around with that a little bit and just see like today you know where am I at and going forward like what's what do I need to take the next step right what's the next step for me in my practice not like what's 10 steps down the line but what's the next one right so if you are if you've crash landed and you're alive still and you're on fire it probably would be stop being on fire you know you'll deal with the broken bones later and whatever else right but you got to get not being on fire first that's the next step right and our own practice the analogy would be like if something that was just like a habit has now become like a destructive addiction right the next step is that has to go first nothing else will be important until that thing goes you're not going anywhere until that thing is gone it's just that's the you know purify your greatest delusion first or some rage has set in right and it's just it's just like killing you you know inside that has to go first nothing else is really going to move until the rage gets damper down the rage destroys merit too so it's like can build much merit in a raging state right or if it's more like okay I'm like lifting off this is a more of a positive sort of it it's like okay what's my next step okay I want to like I want to see what's actually working right now what's the sort of kit that I've put together that's like getting me to lift off what are the circumstances and practices and ideas and whatever that I've set up right now that's getting me to lift off and and what's really working right now what's gonna take me to that next kind of step in my practice okay I didn't get the idea it's just a nice thing to ponder so amidst that and we can just do this in discussion with your partner amidst that maybe we can think about like a little positive moment from the last year and and a low moment spiritually in the last year and it's just really nice to kind of be clear of both of those because you don't just want the highs it's like just eating candy you know it's fun for so long we do want to we want to be aware of the lows you know the tough moments and they're very rich and instructive right okay so this is what we'll just be discussing a bit in the discussion and we'll have some time to do that and then come back and share a little bit okay so then let's see let's have David and Michael and let's have Adriana and Jose and let's have Margaret and Anne and Ryan and Sumit and Marianne and Suzanne all right yeah well done me good matching"

It was just more the fact that you said it in a very cavalier way. Like, oh, I'm just fully on fire.\n\nYeah, no, I appreciate you sharing that. It's really helpful, right? And it's an interesting stage.\n\nAnd I would, like, to me, I would take a stage like that in my practice as, like, not view it as a problem, but more, like, view it as something that's, that's like a recalibration, right? About, like, actually a previous way of practicing that actually wasn't working. Because there's a sense of, like, resistance, right?\n\nTo, like, a seated practice and so on, which is fine. And we don't really need to do much seated practice if we can just practice Dharma in daily life. Like, that's just, that can be completely rich.\n\nAnd we can have a full life around that. But sometimes I find, like, going through an experience like what you're describing, because I've definitely been through these before, I find them helpful to think, like, there is a way I was approaching my practice previously that was really unenjoyable. And that's why I feel kind of relief, almost, at, like, not having to do it.\n\nBecause it wasn't enjoyable, actually, right? And so a moment, like, a phase like that is useful. Because it's like, okay, this is, like, information for me.\n\nThis is actually really helpful. But is there a way to, like, yeah, to find a way of approaching the practice that we love? And it might just be in daily life, right?\n\nIt doesn't have to be in a seated way. It might be just in daily life. But yeah, it'd be a rich thing to ponder.\n\nAnd then with respect to the different lazinesses, yeah, it's a good point. That's often all of them. It doesn't hurt to pull on one of those lovers, though.\n\nLet's see what happens, yeah. Discouragement is the best lover, by far, usually. Other ones are related, but that's a pretty darn good one, yeah.\n\nYeah, thanks so much. I really appreciate you sharing that, Michael. Anyone else?\n\nMaybe one more before we wrap it up?

And what I found is that there's, like, this huge reservoir of information from all the times that I've practiced and all the teachings that I've received over the years. And now it seems that those files or those drawers are starting to reopen and come alive for me.\n\nAnd I'm, like, really making these connections at a very, very, very deep and personal, intimate level. So I'm so happy to be back and very grateful to you, Kano, and to the sangha. Yeah, I just really feel very supported and just so, so happy.\n\nThank you."

And to think of all that beautiful karma that was created, and it was just latent, beckoning, you know, beckoning you. And now you get to harvest some of it, which is an incredible thing to do.\n\nAnd it's a nice example, Mimi. Thank you. Okay, thank you, everyone.\n\nIt's wonderful. So we're back in a couple of weeks. I'll just guide a brief dedication now.\n\nSo we can think of the virtues we've collected through practicing, meditating, and discussing.

But this type of bodhicitta is just so nice to always remember with respect to the center, which is like, we're going to enlightenment together.\n\nAnd to have a view, we'll all attain enlightenment together one day. All of us at the same time. It's just a great view, as a group.\n\nJust as all the people on the boat show up on the other side of the river or the ocean together. So let's just keep having that view. We're all going together.\n\nWe're learning together. We're growing together. We're learning from each other.\n\nWe're supporting each other. And I definitely feel supported by you all. I hope you can feel supported by each other.\n\nAnd that is just such a nice thing to always remember. We're all doing this together. Every day, we can think, I'm on the same boat as all my TTP sangha, going together to enlightenment.\n\nOkay. Thank you very much."
