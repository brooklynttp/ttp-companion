        "text": "Greetings everyone. How's the temperature in here?\n\nToo hot? Too cold? Just right?\n\nAny complaints? No? Okay, that's good.\n\nSo then, let's see. So in person, we've got David, Margaret, Anne P., Marianne, Michael, Jose, Ryan, Fran, Anne, Maura, Sharon, Mimi, Sumit. And then online, we've got Ben, Dale, Neil, Kristen, Grady, Suzanne, and then the fun combo of Emily and Adriana in the same place.\n\nVery exciting. They're trying to steal Kristen and Grady's gig of co-classing. Yeah, you guys have to duke it out after that.\n\nWe can make you all discussion partners in a rare quad discussion group. Very exciting. Okay, well welcome everyone.\n\nIt is incredibly delightful that we can be here today. It's just so wonderful. And I thought I would explode with excitement today, thinking about this class.\n\nI'm just feeling so happy. And it's just so nice being with everyone here. And there's so many amazing practitioners and people in this room together.\n\nAnd we're studying this unique and precious text. I've had the good fortune to be able to study it formally a couple times and teach it a couple times. And then it was my first book I ever, first Kadampa book I ever read.\n\nAnd it was the most precious and magical experience. I read it at the most challenging point in my life, basically. And it was a beacon of hope.\n\nAnd I remember treasuring every moment of reading that book, this book, and feeling so lucky to have found it. And so getting to study this is incredible. And it's very nice because it's aiming to be a bodhisattva, which is essentially a marker that we can aim for, that if we hit that marker, every other stage of the spiritual path will fall naturally.\n\nSo if you hit the marker of being a bodhisattva, everything else will happen, as long as you have a tantric lineage, which we have. And so this is amazing because it's a good enough aim that the rest of the practice will follow. All the realizations leading to enlightenment will follow.\n\nWe'll never turn back again if we develop authentic bodhicitta. Our practice will only forever move forward. But at the same time, it is more approachable than something like enlightenment, which can feel a little bit like, hmm, a little tricky, maybe even far away sometimes.\n\nBut bodhicitta can feel a little closer, just the wish to become enlightened for the benefit of all. Improve myself, benefit others, that's it. We can all do that.\n\nWe can all develop that thought. I want to improve myself and benefit others. I want to become a Buddha for the benefit of all.\n\nIf we can do that spontaneously, 24-7, we are officially a bodhisattva, and we'll never ever turn in the wrong direction again. Our practice will always then continue to enlightenment. So it's wonderful.\n\nIt's like a perfect aim, because it's approachable, or relatively approachable compared to some of the higher aims, but it will lead to all the higher aims itself. So it's very lovely. At the same time, this book is based on a commentary to guide to the bodhisattva's way of life, which is written by Shantideva.\n\nAgain, spontaneously given by Shantideva, which we'll read in not too many pages. Shantideva is a mahasiddha. He's one of the 84 mahasiddhas, a tantric yogi.\n\nSo we'll simultaneously become a mahasiddha ourselves by studying Shantideva's works. We'll learn how to be a tantric yogi, secretly, through his words. For example, in the Ten Benefits of Bodhicitta, he says, just as a supreme elixir transmutes into gold, this human-like body will transform into the body of a Buddha.\n\nAnd this verse doesn't make any sense from the point of view of sutra. Sorry, this body will transform into the body of a Buddha. This verse doesn't make any sense from the point of view of sutra teachings, because you can't turn your ordinary meat body into a Buddha's body.\n\nThat's not the body that turns into a Buddha. It's only a very subtle body, a very subtle one. And so this is implying, actually, that what Shantideva is saying is attain the illusory body, and then become Buddha.\n\nAnd so if we take our tantric goggles out, put them on, and read his text, we'll see so many hidden meanings also. So simultaneously, this is a book that will make us a bodhisattva, if that's what we want, but it will also make us a mahasiddha, a tantric yogi, if that's what we want. So it will do everything we want, in one book.\n\nIt's a very skillful presentation, in that sense. It's very clever, very wise. And again, it's like a miraculous emanation text, because Shantideva also gave this spontaneously, just free-flowed it, as we'll read.\n\nSo it's very nice that Meaningful to Behold is like that also. Geshe-la gave that just free, on a throne, and then it just got edited into this book, just like Shantideva did. It's just like, yeah, it's like an emanation book.\n\nAnd Geshe-la famously said, after he read this book, In Clear Light of Bliss, in English, he said, who wrote that book? Because he didn't know English when he taught these books, according to common appearance. So he said, who wrote that book?\n\nIt must have been Buddha who wrote that book, who gave that book, who transmitted that teaching, because it was their translator at the time. He said, it must have been Buddha, because that wasn't coming from me. It was a transmission of something from beyond, something very precious and unique from another place that came through him.\n\nSo anyway, amazing. We're lucky ducks. Okay.\n\nSo, what we're going to do today is a couple things. We've got two classes, one until 5.30, then we'll take a break for dinner, move about a little bit, change the suffering of our chairs into the suffering of standing up, and then we'll come back at 6, and then go to 7.30. And in the first part, what we're going to do is we're going to look at a major focus that will be in this book, like a really special and important project that we're going to be focusing on at least for a few months. I'm going to talk about that in a moment, and we're going to do what we can do in this session. In the next session, we'll get into more of the nitty-gritty details with the text and TTP and so on.\n\nI do just want to read the foreword. This is by Ch\u00c3\u00b6gyam Trungpa Rinpoche, Geshe's root guru. This is a very precious sort of thing, because this was published in 1977, I believe, and his guru gave him the public support in this book, just so everyone forever can see, because Ch\u00c3\u00b6gyam Trungpa Rinpoche is undoubtedly the holder of the Gandhian lineage, and Geshe-la is his root disciple who has given his teachings unmistakably, because Ch\u00c3\u00b6gyam Trungpa Rinpoche taught the Gandhian lineage instructions relying on the wisdom Dharma protector, Dorje Sugden, and no one else has fully maintained that lineage anywhere. Only Geshe-la did. If that's Ch\u00c3\u00b6gyam Trungpa Rinpoche's principle heart practice, and Geshe-la is the one who has followed that into this world, we can understand he's his heart disciple, holder of this lineage.\n\nSo this intro is vital, just to sort of prove that point. Ch\u00c3\u00b6gyam Trungpa Rinpoche is saying look out for Geshe-la, because he just came from retreat when he wrote this book. He just showed up out of nowhere from retreat, and Ch\u00c3\u00b6gyam Trungpa Rinpoche gave this forward.\n\nThe excellent expounder, the great spiritual master, Kelsang Gyatso, studied myriad Buddhist scriptures at the famous J College of the great monastic university of Sara, Thach-Chen Ling, practiced the meaning of the teachings he received, and became a wise, serious, and realized teacher. May we all say that about ourself one day. I'm wise, realized, and serious.\n\nNot serious as in uptight, but in the sense of being worthy of someone having faith in us. And trusting us. That's why we're not petty, you know, and trivial as a teacher.\n\nFrom the reign of profound and extensive Dharma he has bestowed upon his fortunate disciples, he has recently given comprehensive instruction on the great Bodhisattva Karya Vittara, guide to the Bodhisattva's way of life. The commentary has now been made available in English with the title Meaningful to Behold, known in Tibetan as Tungpa Danden. So if you want to be cool and impress your friends, you tell them, I studied Bodhisattva Karya Vittara.\n\nThank you. This text is the heart essence of all the Sugatas of the three times, and is the unsurpassed practice of the great sons of the conquerors. It explains clearly the mind of Bodhicitta developed through equalizing and exchanging self with others.\n\nThe foundation of the Bodhisattva's way of life. Which as we know, teaches us secretly how to practice Tantra. So it's the fastest way to become a Buddha.\n\nTo develop Bodhicitta, which will make us a Buddha. Equalizing and exchanging. It also explains the benefits of this Mahayana mind, the way we should guard this mind, and how we should practice the great waves of the six perfections once Bodhicitta has been cultivated.\n\nAs a great gathering of the paths of the Mahayana tradition, is therefore worthy to receive many flowers of praise, bestowed with appreciation. I pray and dedicate that all sentient beings may practice sincerely the meaning of the instructions explained in this text. And may thereby accomplish effortlessly the purposes of both themselves and others.\n\nMay they all swiftly reach the enlightened state of the four bodies of a Buddha. By accomplishing all the stages of the spiritual grounds and paths. Vajradhara Tushar Rinpoche.\n\nAmazing. It's beautiful. So, now, we're going to look at something that's going to be very, very important in this class for at least a few months.\n\nAnd it's basically good to have projects like this, because it focuses our mind on a spiritual task. And so that we can see a project to fruition. And the principle practice that will hold our study of this book will be practicing, it's called the six sessions.\n\nSo this is the answer to all of our meditation problems that we may have. It is the solution to all of those problems. And it is the foundation of all good qualities as a meditator.\n\nThere is a wrong conception that meditation is about just doing like a formal practice and then sort of riding that through the day. And as we know, Jason Koppel very famously said that the meditation break is more important than the meditation session, because it's longer. The six sessions, this practice, is about it's supporting a meditation break practice that continues all day.\n\nBut it's through basically doing little mini meditations in the day. So we have to break out of the concept of the one daily practice behemoth that we do and we check off a box and then we go live our life. We have to break out of that concept.\n\nThat is a made up concept. That's nothing to do with Kadampa Buddhism. That there is just this one daily practice that someone does, checks off the box and goes into their life.\n\nKadampa Buddhism, as Geshe-la says in modern Buddhism, cannot be separated from daily life. So it cannot be separated from daily life. So we want to be mindful every moment of the entire day.\n\nWe want to basically have our whole day be a sadhana. We want our whole day to be our daily practice or our seated practice. But as we are moving and walking and talking and going about, we want the whole day to be pervaded by it.\n\nBut it's difficult to have that level of mindfulness all day. So the six sessions and making these pillars of our life, they connect us to a beautiful, virtuous feeling. Even if it's just for 30 seconds, or a minute, or five minutes.\n\nThese six sessions are like pillars that hold up the palace of our mindfulness in the day. Or you could say they are like outposts of mindfulness where we connect to a powerful, positive, virtuous feeling. But then slowly leaks out into the time in between.\n\nSo these... There's so much to say about this! Oh my gosh!\n\nLet me read a little bit from this fantastic book called The Handbook for the Daily Practice, The Bodhisattva Vows and Tantric Vows. I don't know if you've ever seen this one. It's important.\n\nIf you go to a tantric empowerment, they will talk about this in the first teaching, almost 100% chance. And they'll say, get this handbook. This thing is incredible.\n\nWe should know that in truth, our commitments to the Pratimoksha Bodhisattva and Tantric Vows are the only method to solve our own and others' problems. And the only method to make ourselves and others happy. Only, good word.\n\nThis is what we really need. We should never think that our commitments are like heavy luggage. But always think they're like a wish-fulfilling jewel that has been given to us by Buddha.\n\nAnd we should keep them purely at the cost of our life. So part of the six sessions is... It's called six-session guru yoga, principally.\n\nBut part of it is that we do a handful of different practices six times a day. We aspire to. If we have received Bodhisattva Vows, it's to take the Bodhisattva Vows briefly.\n\nWe go for refuge to the Three Jewels and confess individually our negative actions. I rejoice in the virtues of all beings and promise to accomplish a Buddhist enlightenment. So we take a vow to retake that six times a day.\n\nAlso to basically think about the benefits of bodhicitta six times a day, which is an amazing chapter and meaningful to be told about. This is why we're getting into this now, so that when we get there, we will have a structure to put those points in. We also, if we take high-sukhatantra empowerment, we take a vow to retake the 19 commitments of the five Buddha families.\n\nWe can do this in an elaborate way, or we can do it in a brief way that's contained in this text here. I go for refuge to the Guru and Three Jewels. Holding Vajra and Bell, I generate as the deity and make offerings.\n\nI rely upon the dharmas of sutra and tantra and refrain from all non-virtuous actions. Gathering all virtuous dharmas, I help all living beings through the practice of the four givings. It's basically like a mini self-generation practice that we do six times a day.\n\nSo, the thing that we're going to be aiming towards is setting up, each one of us, six sessions in our day. And it doesn't have to be rigid. It doesn't have to be exactly those words.\n\nIt could contain whatever you would like. It could contain juggling, if you like, or pogo sticking, or whatever you're into. No, I'm just kidding.\n\nYou're totally free. You can do anything you want. But the point is to create these six sessions as cognitive structures in the mind that are like impenetrable, immovable cognitive structures, which they will be.\n\nIf you just do it for a month in a way that you really like, not in a way that's rigid or rote, but in a way that you really like, if you do it for a month and you keep the six sessions, there'll be these cognitive structures that will just be there. They'll just start to function on their own, like an engine that runs their own. They run on their own in our mind.\n\nSo the idea is to set these up. The way to set it up is to first think about what is my daily schedule like? There's a handful of kind of schedules that we all have.\n\nThere's the 9-to-5-er type person, or the 6-to-6-er, or whatever you are, 8-to-8-er. So people with that kind of typical workday schedule. And then there's people that just sort of have a typical kind of food orientation at least, even if they don't have a normal schedule.\n\nSo they have their breakfast, lunch, dinner, and then there's some other options for people who don't have a clear kind of schedule. So the 9-to-5-er version is like a typical version of this. This would be wake up, a little morning practice thing, just a touch base.\n\nIt could be one minute, it could be a more substantial time. So that's 2. And then they would do one at the beginning of the workday, 3.\n\nOne at the beginning of the afternoon, 4. One when they get home from work, 5. Bedtime, 6.\n\nThat would be like a traditional one for like a 9-to-5-er person. The meal-oriented person would have breakfast, sorry, wake up and dinner. Sorry, wake up and sleep.\n\nYou see how meal-oriented I am. Wake up and sleep as like the book ends. Breakfast, lunch, dinner.\n\nAnd then at some other point maybe in like a seated practice. Again, even if it's a quick small one, like it could be a couple minutes. Or it could be a more substantial one, like if you do Harchul or quick bath or whatever.\n\nSo that's another way to do it. So for example, if you do have your meals but your day isn't traditionally structured, that might be more appropriate for you. Then there's the every 3-hour version, which is good especially for those of us who don't have a clear structure to our days.\n\nFor example, if like you're retired and your days are just open space. The every 3 hours is really nice because it just marks like a rhythm to the day, like a heartbeat to the day. And then those hours start to become sacred, which makes the practice quite easy.\n\nBecause you just think, it's 12, I know exactly what I do at 12. It's 3, I know exactly what I do at 3. It's 6, I know exactly what I do at 6.\n\nFor some people this doesn't work, right? Like if you're doing a 9-5, your 3pm might be in the middle of some crazy meeting. There's no way it's happening.\n\nSo that schedule doesn't work for you. So the every 3 hours is wake up and maybe it's wake up, 9, 12, 3, 6, 9. Something like that.\n\nAnd then the last option to do it is the total variable option. For those of us who have strange lives, I can say myself included, this is what I have to do. Which is where every single day of my week is different.\n\nSo I can't actually do it one way every single day. Which is annoying, but thankfully my Mondays are all the same. And my Tuesdays are all the same.\n\nAnd my Wednesdays are all the same. It's just none of those days are the same. This is more annoying.\n\nBut it's more batching the day based on themes. So the days I have a commute, I do my succession at the beginning of the commute. Because I know that's a pain point sometimes, or it can be complicated, or it can be long, or I can just get ordinary in my thinking.\n\nSo it's like, okay, I'm definitely going to put that there in my commute. Or like, if I know I have certain classes back to back, and I might not have space in between, I might have to do it one at the beginning of them, and then one at the end of them. So it's like doing it by themes has some pluses, because you match the session to the themes of the day, and the energy to the day.\n\nBut it can be more complicated, because it's quite random. And so you have to be pretty thoughtful about it. Okay, so those are the options.\n\nI think that covers everyone on earth. Except Michael. Let's get him the mic.\n\nMic for Michael. Okay, yep, right there."

        "text": "Oh, 100%. That's the thing. This is one of the things that we'll discover through this practice.\n\nIs that we'll break down correlating meditation with stillness, and being physically still, or eyes closed. We'll start to see meditation is a mental action. The sensory ephemera that we're experiencing through our five senses are just like an illusion.\n\nIt's just light. Just play of light and sound and whatever. Our mind can be doing anything.\n\nWe want an ability for our mind to be in profound places, even when our senses are doing seemingly ordinary things. 100%. The thing with this is that sometimes longer will end up being more enjoyable than shorter and rushed.\n\nWe might find that. If you do this for a bit, aiming for a minute in the six sessions, you might find that they just feel kind of rote and a little bit boring. The answers usually make them longer.\n\nAgain, you might think, but no! If we make them a little bit longer, or just choose one or two to be a little bit longer, like make one or two five minutes instead of one minute, we'll find a little blissful joy in them. Then we'll start to like, we just can't wait to our next one.\n\nThey'll start to be ones that we crave. But you can do that while walking. The goal is to be in the mandala 24-7, walking, talking, running, whatever.\n\nOur mind is in the Pure Land 24-7. That's the aim one day. We want to be able to be in very profound places while active.\n\nAgain, if we study the Mahasiddhas, these great yogis and yoginis of the past, they were all like working people, basically, except a couple. They were all like people living daily lives, running around, doing tons of stuff. They are the exemplary practitioners of tantra.\n\nIt's very interesting, right? It's the people who are active that are exemplary, not the people who are squirreled away, doing nothing, who are exemplary. That's something we want to start thinking about a little bit.\n\nWhat is it actually about the activity that makes it even more profound and deep? I'm going to say a little bit about that right now. And then a little bit about workshopping this.\n\nGeshe-la once told someone who was helping build the temple in New York, who was a long-time yogi meditator, and the person was very frustrated because he couldn't do his daily practice. He said to that person, just meditate on bodhicitta six times a day for one minute, and that's your whole practice. The person was used to doing their tantric sadhana and heart troll every day and teaching a few classes and just living a very nice meditative lifestyle.\n\nAnd so he was really frustrated. He was getting mad. I can't do that.\n\nI'm working on this temple. It's getting in the way. And feeling this aversion towards physical activity.\n\nGeshe-la said, no, it's no problem at all. Just forget all of that. Don't do any of it.\n\nJust meditate on bodhicitta six times a day for one minute. Really focused. And this person, who is this amazing teacher and Buddhist monk, I remember him telling me this, and he decided it was the deepest meditation he had done in a decade.\n\nBecause he just was really going for it, but then he was really bringing that into his daily life. And so what can happen is that if we start to fall in love with a seated practice or get into a seated practice, there's an extreme that can set in, which is an aversion for everything that is not that. It's basically an aversion for activity.\n\nAt first, people can't get a seated practice going. Then they get a seated practice going, and then they start having an aversion for the non-seated practice life. So they view their work as a problem, or they view running around helping people as a problem, or they view doing things as a problem.\n\nAnd it feels like, ooh, that's getting in the way of what I really want to do. So this is basically starting to view our Dharma practice as like fine china, which is like specialized stuff that we keep in a little private place for the right time, but has no relevance to our real life. And this is the opposite of what Kadampa Bodhisattva is about.\n\nIt's about bringing enlightenment into every moment of our life, like moving towards virtue and enlightenment in every single moment of our life, having no moment that feels ordinary. And so if our private seated practice feels uniquely more holy and special than taking out the trash, then actually we've created a delusion in our mind, or running to work, or being yelled at by our boss. These things can...\n\nVery easily, actually, if we do the six sessions well, we'll very easily reach a state where we think, this is the same. Being yelled at by my boss is the same as sitting on my meditation cushion for me. Because I'm just in a meditative state.\n\nAnd actually it's even more fun, because I'm resisting my ordinary appearances so clearly now. I'm not maybe resisting my ordinary appearances when I'm on a meditation cushion, cuddled up in front of my shrine. I might actually be kind of buying into them quite a bit, because I'm trying to control my life, and make it so kind of sterilized and safe so I can meditate, versus the person getting yelled at by their boss, who can do it.\n\nThey're actively opposing ordinary appearances. They're not buying in. So they're really doing something amazing.\n\nI remember a friend of mine, he said, when he really fell in love with the six session practice, he was teaching a PE class, I think it was swimming or something like that. It was the middle of the day, he was tired as heck, in some hot pool or something like that. And he paused to do his six session practice.\n\nWell, his eyes are open, because he has to keep doing it. And he said it was in that moment that he fell in love with it. Because it felt like that moment was as holy and sacred as his most precious meditation moments that he's ever had.\n\nAnd that made him see, that's what modern Buddhism is. He was like, this is no different than being on a meditation retreat, being right here. Because my mind is somewhere holy and sacred.\n\nThat's the whole practice. And this is one of the things that we can break down, is this kind of aversion for non-quietude. And just aversion for the non-seated time.\n\nFor those who have problems with the seated practice and getting it going, the six sessions is fantastic, because you stop being rigid about what a seated practice looks like, and you start just having fun with doing something that will touch your heart. Even if it's 30 seconds, even if it's one minute. And you start to feel like, I can do something that touches my heart six times a day.\n\nThere are no rules on how long our meditation has to be. There's no rules. That is made up.\n\nSo we never have to feel bad, or less than, or that we're not doing a good job, or whatever, if the seated time isn't some long elaborate thing. And actually, the way to build up the seated time that we love, is learning to love these little dives into virtue for a minute here or there throughout the day. It will just organically kind of grow.\n\nNot because we have to or we're supposed to, but just because we're having so much fun. We just can't help ourselves to simmer a little bit longer. So it's helpful for both people, basically.\n\nThose who are a little bit attached to quietude, and silence, and stillness, and those who have a hard time with that. The six sessions solves both problems. Okay, last little thing, and then I'm just going to give us a few minutes to workshop it a little bit.\n\nSo, what we're going to do is we're going to take just a little time, and we're going to try to identify what, for me, are my six times in my day. And, again, each one of us has a different schedule, so come up with different things. And then, if it does need to be one of the variable ones, attempt, to some degree, to match it by theme.\n\nParticularly pain points is a good theme to match it by. Like the tough parts of the day that you don't like. Like maybe you don't like being alone at night.\n\nLike at the end of the day. And some loneliness creeps in, and some boredom creeps in. Great, that's a pain point.\n\nGot that one. Down. Maybe mornings are tough.\n\nWhatever. Waking up. Okay.\n\nMaybe the commute's tough. Fantastic. Got that one.\n\nSo, like this. In each of those six sessions, what's nice is to think of them as little mini-days. Each one of them.\n\nIt's like six mini-days that we're living each day. And kind of asking, what do I need for my practice in this day? It's like a little three-hour day.\n\nOr something. So, for example, for me, it took me a very long time to be aware of how irritable and grumpy I get in the afternoon. And to think just something about that time.\n\nIt's hard. I don't know why. It's not like that for everyone, but it is for me.\n\nSo I had to think, what are practices for me that I need in my afternoon session before I go into that space? And I need things that are going to actively oppose my irritable and grumpiness. Like maybe a meditation on love.\n\nLike wishing love. Or it might be something on emptiness. Or maybe it's more like really guarding my speech and thinking, okay, I've got to really think about my speech in this next mini-day.\n\nBecause I know I get grumpy here and I take it out on people. So that's kind of the theme of that day. It's like, okay, I have to be watching out for my grumpiness.\n\nGot to use some little mini-ideas or meditations that are going to make me loving and kind and a little bit more light-hearted and a little bit less intense. But then for me, the end of the day is like the wrap-up phase. And it's totally different than the beginning of the day or the middle of the day.\n\nIt's more about reflecting on how the day went and how the practice went. And getting ready for my yoga of sleep in that sacred time, like going into the clear light. And so it's actually like a different day.\n\nIt's a totally different feel and theme. So this is what's really fun about this. We actually start to see each day I live many different days.\n\nThere's actually a lot of different energies in one day. And there's lots of different types of challenges and strengths. And then I can set up my successions to approach that.\n\nAnd to work with that. And to work with the good momentum and be aware of the not-so-good momentum that might be there. Last thing is, you can give them a name.\n\nAnd that makes it much more fun. I have nothing else to say about that. If you give it a name, it's just cooler.\n\nYeah, it might as well. This part of the day is turtle time. Whatever.\n\nI don't know why that came to mind. You can give it a name. It makes it more interesting.\n\nOoh, now I'm in this part of the day. I love this one. It's always like this.\n\nAnd there's a little bit of that. That person comes around and bothers me at this point. Yeah, I'm ready.\n\nI'm just going to be brief just to get the ball rolling. Five minutes or so. Seven minutes.\n\nDo your best. Mark out the times and when they might be. Theoretically.\n\nAnd what would be the challenges in that time. And what you'd want to bring in into the sessions that would be relevant for those times. And again, each one can be very different.\n\nYou can use the Bodhisattva Vow and Tantric Vows. But it could just be like, I want to think about wishing love a little bit at that time. Or I want to think about emptiness a little bit at that time.\n\nOr whatever you feel like you need. Okay, good. So we have some paper somewhere in the back.\n\nWe also have crayons if you want to color a little bit on your succession plan. And then we'll come back in a few minutes. You can make a different color.\n\nExactly. Okay, cool. Thank you."

I'm retired and I do different things.\n\nTo allow myself to lay it out every morning. And sort it off that way. This is how this day is going to go.\n\nI like waking first thing in the morning. And I made it also somehow tied to food. Because I still struggle with remembering to offer my food.\n\nSo here's another opportunity for me to remember to offer my food. If I do this before lunch and before dinner. I like to have a lazy morning.\n\nSo I like the idea that after I allow myself a brief lazy morning to make it the second session. So that I don't feel guilty about my lazy morning. And the last thing I want to do is I'm so excited to use these little notebooks that I already have and have been holding on to years to somehow have a use for.\n\nI want to make a little check every day. A check off for myself that I've done all six. And part of the first thing in the morning is I have an accountability buddy to check in how I did the day before with my six sessions.\n\nAnd I've done with my regular meditation with my other practices that that's really kept me on track."

That's a great way to transform something that maybe we consider a lazy morning into a spiritual morning. And it's not lazy anymore.\n\nBecause lazy is just not liking virtue. So if we're doing our six sessions a couple of times, it's not lazy by any means. And then using a grid and checking off.\n\nIt does help a ton. Having a physical checklist with this practice. And maybe we're not perfect right away.\n\nBut maybe we do one or two the first couple of days. And then we get to three eventually. And then we get to four eventually.\n\nAnd then we get to six.

That's the name.\n\nIt's a good name. The most important one. Volume 1.\n\nThe most important one. Volume 2.

We're just looking at this in FB this week, but if you're sending a telecommunications signal across the country, you can send a really powerful one and let it slowly degrade as it goes across the country. Or you can send just an average one and have it repeat the same signal over and over.\n\nAnd that's what people do. They don't send a huge powerful one and let it degrade. They just send a tiny one or a medium-sized one and then it just gets repeated, kind of reinvigorated so often.\n\nAnd so we can do that with our practice. Have the successions become like that. They become like these little repeaters that maintain where we're at.\n\nAnd then actually it starts to grow. So instead of going up to a high and then going down, it's like maybe we don't go to a mega high, but we just build very nice and gradually.

Acknowledgements.\n\nTeachings contained in this book were originally delivered as a series of lectures to students at Manjushri Kadampa Meditation Center in England, by Venerable Geshe Kelsang Gyatso Rinpoche. For more than three months, beginning in late 1977, Venerable Geshe Kelsang gave a verse-by-verse oral commentary to Shantideva's 8th century masterpiece, Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life, one of the most famous and important texts studied in Mahayana Buddhism. From the depths of our hearts, we thank the author for his inconceivable kindness in composing this book.\n\nThroughout the presentation and revision of these teachings, Venerable Geshe Kelsang has demonstrated by his compassion, wisdom, and inexhaustible patience, that the Bodhisattva path to enlightenment is still being followed 1,200 years after Shantideva, and 2,500 years after the passing away of Buddha Shakyamuni. There can be no greater proof of the immense value of the Bodhisattva's Way of Life than the living example of such a realized master. We also thank all the dedicated senior Dharma students who assisted the author with the rendering of the English and who prepared the final manuscript for publication.\n\nPlease note that the numbers in square brackets for the text refer to verse numbers in Shantideva's root text, Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life, a full translation of which is available separately.

        "text": "So now this book has a special meaning to me. I was born in 1977. Not just the Bodhisattva and the Six Perfections.\n\nMaybe you're one of Geshe's emanations. Very nice. Well, now it's special to all of us.\n\nIt wasn't special until now. Technically, he started teaching in 1977. The book wasn't published until then.\n\nIt wasn't publicized until after he was done with all those teachings, which is years later. But 1977 is when Geshe showed up at Manjushri Center and then was requested to teach. So he gave these teachings.\n\nA couple other bits here. I'm going to say something about Roy. He's listed there.\n\nSo around this time, actually, when he took over as the administrative director, Roy was one of the first students of Geshe at Manjushri Center. He's one of the people who requested him to come. And he's this incredibly humble example.\n\nFor example, not too long ago, there was a big festival, and a friend of mine, who is a bit boisterous, sat next to a fellow. And then didn't know him. She asked him how he was doing, and he said, yeah, I'm fine, whatever.\n\nAnd then she proceeded to give him advice for about 40 minutes. And as she got up, she told me, she said, I was just giving that guy advice. He's really down and out.\n\nAnd it was Roy. And he just sat there so happy, receiving her advice, just cherishing her. Because she doesn't get to give people advice a lot.\n\nShe's usually the one getting advice. And she has an unruly mind, I think, in a lot of ways, and she would admit that. So she doesn't get to be the teacher a lot.\n\nShe's often running into problems and getting help. And he just sat there so happy, for like 45 minutes. And she was saying, yeah, he just seems a bit depressed and down and really needs some help.\n\nAnd we were like, that's Roy Tyson. And she just couldn't believe it. Because she just didn't know him.\n\nBut that's a humble person, right? He probably felt like he was getting the better deal. Like he was so happy.\n\nAnyway, when he took over as the admin director, there were a lot of people at Manjushri Center who were a little critical of him. Because any time you're the boss, people criticize you. It's just their coping mechanism for their own pain, right?\n\nTo blame the authorities. That's how we escape from our pain. To blame other people, including authorities.\n\nSo the Dharma Center, unfortunately, that's no different. So then Geshe-la called a meeting for the whole community. He busted in there.\n\nAnd he said, you all are just meditating. You're just sitting around meditating. Roy is like a real bodhisattva.\n\nBecause he's living the bodhisattva's way of life. And so he said, you have to all respect Roy. I'm just saying it because his name is listed here.\n\nBut it also relates to this point that we were looking at in the first session. It's very easy to live a somewhat peaceful life in quietude. It's a whole other thing to actively be cherishing people and transforming our mind.\n\nThat's a different thing. And people who can really do that are facing up to their delusions courageously and strongly. And they're not running away.\n\nAnd that's what Geshe was saying. Roy is the real deal. You guys are giving him a hard time while you're sitting in your rooms just meditating, quote-unquote, all day.\n\nHe's actually creating these conditions for you all day. He's like a real bodhisattva. So it's just a beautiful example.\n\nWhenever I've spent time at Manjushri, I'll find Roy at 5 a.m. mopping the hall, which is one of his jobs, mopping the main hall, which is this huge, never-ending hallway. And he does it when no one can see him. He sneaks up and he mops it.\n\nSo happy. So anyway, he's just an amazing fellow. And it's nice for us to rejoice in these other practitioners.\n\nAnd we're going to be talking about this a little bit as we look at Shantideva's life story in a moment. Because it's actually helpful for us to think about our own little Dharma story, our own little Dharma biography. And even maybe write it down.\n\nAnd rejoice in other people's Dharma stories. And delight in them. So we can delight in Roy, but we can delight in all of our amazing practitioners here."

        "text": "So then, introduction. This present text is a commentary to Shantideva's guide to the bodhisattva's way of life, Bodhisattva Karyavatara, and is divided into three parts. The preeminent qualities of the author.\n\nAn introduction to the text. The explanation of the actual text. Preeminent qualities of the author.\n\nIt's customary at the beginning of commentaries such as this to give a biography of the author. In this case, the great Indian appendant, Shantideva. 687-763 CE.\n\nThere now follows a very brief account drawn from traditional sources. Shantideva was born the crown prince of a royal family in Gujarat, a kingdom in western India. His father was King Kushalavarmana, armor of virtue, and his mother was recognized as an emanation of the tantric deity Vajragini.\n\nAt his birth, the prince received the name Shantivarmana, armor of peace. Even as a very young boy, Shantivarmana showed great ability in spiritual matters, and by the age of seven, was already highly skilled in the inner science of religion. His principal teacher at the time was a yogi who had so fully developed penetrating wisdom that it's said he achieved unity with Manjushri, the Buddha embodying the wisdom of all enlightened beings.\n\nWhen Shantivarmana himself engaged in meditation retreat, he too received a direct vision of Manjushri and many prophetic omens as well. Shortly afterwards, King Kushalavarmana died, leaving Shantivarmana to inherit the throne. The night before his intended coronation, however, Manjushri appeared to him in a dream.\n\nHe told the prince that he should renounce his kingdom and become a celibate monk. Immediately upon waking, Shantivarmana fled the palace, disappeared into the forest to meditate. Once again, he received a vision of Manjushri who handed him a symbolic wooden sword.\n\nUpon taking it, Shantivarmana attained eight perfect realizations and then traveled to the great monastic university of Nalanda where he took ordination from the abbot Jayadeva, God of Victory, and was given the ordination name of Shantideva, God of Peace. At Nalanda, Shantideva's spiritual development progressed rapidly, especially as a result of his training in the profound and demanding methods of Tantra. However, because he did all his practices secretly at night and rested during the day, it appeared to others that he performed only three activities, eating, sleeping, and defecating.\n\nFor this reason, the other monks sarcastically referred to him as the three realizations. It's helpful, you know, we have to always remember all Buddha's teachings are to be taken as personal advice and put into practice, right? So what is that teaching us?\n\nIt's like, how do we do this with our Sangha? How do we say, they're not practicing, you know, the way that they should be? Blah, blah, blah.\n\nRight? That's what I want to ask myself when I read this, right? When do I do what these monks are doing, Shantideva, right?\n\nAnd wag my finger at other people when I need to look at my own mind, right? And train my own mind, right? So it's like, again, these are always teachings for us to put into practice.\n\nSo we don't want to read this as like, oh yeah, cool, yeah, three realizations, cool, okay. It's like, what's this teaching me? Do I judge others?\n\nDo I judge my Sangha? Do I kind of scorn them, right? Or look down on them for certain things because they're not like me or they don't practice in my way or because I think they're something that they might not be, right?\n\nAnd how can I use that as a mirror for my own mind? Feeling he was very irresponsible, a very irresponsible monk and a discredit to their illustrious university, they devised a plan to get rid of him. This is the way we like to deal with people we don't like.\n\nGet rid of them. Which as we know, the real way to get rid of all enemies is to abandon our anger. That's the way to eliminate all enemies from the earth.\n\nAn enemy is just an appearance, a creation of an angry mind. So that's the way to get rid of all of our enemies. So again, this is a teaching, right?\n\nHow do we push away when we're getting deluded towards someone? How do we try to control them and push them away? Where do we do that in our life?\n\nWhere do we try to excommunicate instead of working with our own state of mind and own up to our own delusions? Incorrectly believing him to be deficient in meditational ability and ignorant of doctrinal theory, they arranged for Shantideva to deliver a discourse before the entire monastery. Their idea was that he would be so humiliated by this exposure of his ignorance that he would be shamed into leaving.\n\nF minus intention. It's the worst possible intention you could imagine. Yeah.\n\nAs we might know about Geshe-la's life story, he said when he went into retreat he felt like the happiest he had ever been in his life. It wasn't like escaping the monastery itself, but he just said the monastery was so focused on just intellectual stuff that he was just so happy to actually go into the teachings for the first time. The point there is, again, it's like a teaching for us.\n\nWe don't want to create a dharma center that's just intellectual. We want to create a dharma center that's really practicing from the heart. We don't want to be like this monastery at the time.\n\nIt's like evaluating people based on what they seem to know in a scholarly way. We want to value the practice in people's hearts or just value people regardless. It's a reminder.\n\nIt's easy to have a spiritual pride and use it to look down on people. It's like, okay, where do I do that? When the day of the scheduled public humiliation arrived, Shantideva mounted the teaching throne and, much to the amazement of those assembled, delivered a discourse which, when written down, became known as a guide to the bodhisattva's way of life.\n\nStill considered the best set of instructions ever written for becoming a bodhisattva, a being bound for full enlightenment. I talked about this last week, but the point here is up to that point, there were teachings on this topic. But then when Shantideva did this, people were like, now it's done.\n\nNow the teaching on how to be a bodhisattva has been given. And everything else forever will just be commentary to this. So it's a very precious text, written around 700.\n\n1300 years ago, right? 1200 years ago. It's a very long time ago, and people just sort of concluded at that point, and until this day, people just agree, like, this is the text on how to become a bodhisattva.\n\nSo it's amazing, it has this authenticity to it that we really want to admire. It's like, it's kind of served the test of time. Right?\n\nIt's gone through generations and generations and generations, and people could have, like, moved on to something else, or get a more updated teaching, or get something a little spicier and different, or whatever, but everyone has just, like, constantly kept this text as, like, a thread for over a thousand years. Right? And so it's just helpful to think about that, right?\n\nLike, this is the teaching on how to become a bodhisattva. And we get to study it. So lucky.\n\nAs he was expounding the ninth chapter, dealing with the wisdom, apprehending the true nature of reality, he uttered, everything is like space. So that's the verse, right, that we all know, that's in modern Buddhism, et cetera, right? You know, who is it that is living?\n\nWho is it that will die? What is the future? What is the past?\n\nWho are our friends? Who are our relatives? I beseech you, who are like me, know that all things are empty like space.\n\nThis is from Shantideva, a very famous verse. And it was at that point where he shot up into the sky. It's nice.\n\nLike, as we study this text and guide the bodhisattva's way of life, the root text, it feels like it's evaporating into emptiness as you study it. And each chapter becomes more and more on emptiness. And it's pervaded by the teachings on emptiness.\n\nIt's very skillful, the way it's taught. Even the patient's chapter, chapter five, six, sorry, is all about emptiness as a way to practice patience. Even chapter five, guarding alertness, which is the moral discipline chapter, is starting to teach the profound teachings on emptiness, saying that everything is coming from the mind.\n\nTherefore all you need to do is control the mind and you control everything. That's where the famous verse on putting the shoes on, the leather on the soles of the feet comes from, right? Which is a tantric teaching.\n\nPurify your mind, purify your world. Pure mind, pure world. Leather on the soles of the feet is the same as leather covering the whole earth.\n\nSo it's very beautiful the way Shantideva teaches. He's so skillful. He's leading everyone into the sixth perfection of wisdom the whole way.\n\nHe wants people to realize emptiness, but he understands he has to teach the other perfections to get people there. So you feel the words just starting to fall away and dissolve away. And all the methods are getting more and more into dissolving the self and all phenomena.\n\nEspecially the eighth chapter on exchanging, equalizing self and others. It's basically a meditation on the emptiness of the self, but also a meditation on the emptiness of a mental continuum, meditation on the emptiness of other, meditation on the emptiness of pain. It's all in there.\n\nIt's so beautiful. Even rhetorically, it's beautiful, the way it's composed. It's like a miraculous text.\n\nSo beautifully composed even. At this point, he began to rise in the sky, flying higher and higher until he could no longer be seen, although his voice could still be clearly heard. It was in this miraculous manner that the remainder of the ninth chapter and the entirety of the tenth were delivered.\n\nHaving no desire to return to Nalanda, yeah, no thanks, Shantideva left for South India. Needless to say, the monks he left behind were profoundly impressed and somewhat bewildered by Shantideva's teachings and his display of miracle powers. Shortly thereafter, a dispute arose about these teachings.\n\nThe Kashmiri pandits claimed that Shantideva taught only nine chapters, while some of the scholars from Magadha, who possess great powers of memorization, argued that he, in fact, taught ten. It was decided that the only way to resolve this disagreement would be to hear the teachings once again. So several monks left Nalanda and searched the one they had once despised and requested him to repeat his discourse.\n\nThis he did, and he also gave them the text of his compendium of teachings, Shikshasamukhagaya, which also explains the practices of a bodhisattva. From that time onwards, the study and practice of Shantideva's works flourished widely throughout India and other Mahayana Buddhist lands. So let me show you a little bit more and then we'll take a couple of points from this.\n\nShantideva's fame spread farther and farther. Many non-Buddhists became jealous. One of the greatest teachers, Shankadeva, challenged Shantideva to a debate on the condition that the loser forsake his own doctrine for that of the winner.\n\nBy the use of miracle powers and impeccable logic, Shantideva emerged victorious. Thereby bringing Shankadeva and all of his disciples into the Buddhist fold. Wouldn't it be nice if that's how the internet debates happened?\n\nAh, you win! I will now follow your way of viewing things. When was the last time we told someone, Ah, you were completely right.\n\nI was completely wrong. Now I follow your view. I didn't do that.\n\nYou didn't? Well, that's very good. Not everyone does, but it's a beautiful thing if you do.\n\nIt's a sign of intellectual integrity. We all want to do that. So a different time than today.\n\nOn another occasion, when there was a great famine in South India, Shantideva announced that he would perform an act of generosity. The next day, many people gathered to see what he would do. Shantideva then proceeded to satisfy the hunger of the entire mass of people with a single bowl of rice.\n\nBecause of this, the local people all developed great faith in Shantideva and adopted the Buddhist way of life as their own. This has only been a brief biography of the great Bodhisattva Shantideva, who throughout his entire life performed countless deeds for the sake of spreading Buddhist teachings, the Dharma, and helping sentient beings. Even today, those who are fortunate enough to read, study, and meditate on his outstanding texts can find them a source of great insight and benefit.\n\nSo we want to follow Shantideva's example. Maybe not necessarily in feeding one bowl of rice to lots of people, but his example of attaining deep realizations. One of the aspects of example is that he truly did not care what anyone thought about him at all.\n\nHe's just totally free, mentally. No attachment to anything. Reputation, praise, resources, pleasure, and so on.\n\nAnd he valued his spiritual practice. And he knew what he was doing was right. So he like, fearlessly followed that.\n\nSo again, we can ask ourselves, what are my attachments to the eight worldly concerns, like pleasure, resources, reputation, praise, things like this, right? And then not receiving those things. What's my attachment to the eight worldly concerns like?\n\nShantideva is this example of the embodiment of someone who has abandoned attachment to the eight worldly concerns. And we can see his freedom. This is important, as a Dharma practitioner, because we can be influenced by the ordinary view in the world.\n\nWe might not be influenced by things like normal peer pressure and stuff like that. Maybe we've matured past those kind of concerns. But we can definitely be influenced by the self-grasping ignorance of the world.\n\nAnd let that kind of affect our mind. And let that seep into our own way of thinking and being. Which is a type of actual attachment to reputation and so on.\n\nBecause part of what we're doing in these practices, even though from an outer point of view we want to just remain natural while changing our aspiration, we can be doing profound spiritual things while looking completely ordinary on the outside, just like a kind person. At the same time, many of these practices are completely contrary to the belief of inherent existence, which is the belief of the world. That's the most overwhelming peer pressure.\n\nIt's about inherent existence. Inherent and existent pleasure coming from the outside. Inherent and existent pain coming from the outside.\n\nInherent and existent good or bad. Inherent and existent world news. Inherent and existent bad guys, good guys, and whatever.\n\nAnd so, part of our practice needs to be being like Shantideva and not being influenced by these delusions of the world. And having the courage to do that. And it's helpful to consider the story from the Perfection Wisdom Sutras which was one of the teachings Geshe-la gave early on at Manjushri Center called Great Mother of Conquers, which is a commentary to the traditional Perfection Wisdom Sutras in 10,000 lines, which is a very impenetrable text and he was doing his best to make it make sense for everyone.\n\nIt almost became one of the books. And then people, he read it and was just like, no one is going to benefit from this practically. So it was like almost a complete manuscript and then he just dissolved it.\n\nBut in his teachings, he gave this story, right, of a long time ago, there was a king and the king got a prediction from a seer, a clairvoyant person, that there was a poison rain that was going to come. And the poison rain was going to make everyone go crazy. And then he needed to cover his water in his backyard or whatever and everyone needed to cover their water.\n\nAnd then the king did it. He covered his little pond in the back where he got his water from or whatever. And then no one else did because they thought he was wacky.\n\nAnd then the rain came and everyone went completely insane. Right? Because they got this poison rain in their body.\n\nAnd the king was the only sane person left walking around and everyone else was walking around backwards and talking in gibberish and doing all these strange things. And he was just the only sane person left. It was like a bunch of people getting lead poisoning or something.\n\nRight? And just going completely bonkers. Except him.\n\nAnd then eventually they concluded he was the crazy one. Right? And sort of, I think they forced him to drink the water.\n\nWhich is scary. Yeah. It's about, I mean there's many lessons in that teaching.\n\nRight? But the view of inherent existence is crazy. That's the crazy view.\n\nIt is completely crazy. It is also the dominant view by far in the world. By far.\n\nAnd people will stop us if we try to convince them otherwise. There are people who will not like that. Right?\n\nThat things are empty. They do not like that. Certain aspects of that especially.\n\nSo we're going in the opposite direction with respect to ultimate truth. Our behavior, we're going in the same direction. Being kind and loving.\n\nAt least in an acceptable direction. Our outer behavior. Kind and loving and generous and supporting the world.\n\nBut inwardly, we're trying to realize emptiness. The things we normally see do not exist at all. Right?\n\nWhich is completely contrary. So, anyway the point of this is we need to have a little bit of the Shantideva quality of being impervious and trusting our wisdom and trusting our guru. And not being influenced by these views of inherent existence which are everywhere.\n\nAnd it's very difficult to do this. And a practice like the succession guru yoga will help a lot. Because we'll at least dissolve the world away six times a day and become Haruka or Vajragini for a bit.\n\nPart of the succession commitment is remembering all the things we normally see do not exist. So doing that six times a day for like a minute will make a huge impact on this belief. So the point is let's all have that courage to like follow the six perfections.\n\nGiving moral discipline, patience, effort, concentration, wisdom and especially the sixth perfection. Perfectional wisdom. Realizing everything is like a dream.\n\nAnd we do that for the benefit of everyone everywhere. Then we'll have a little time for discussion now. I'll make some quick partners and then we'll go from there.\n\nSo we can have... It's complicated today because there's new people, etc. How about this?\n\nNo, I'm going to decide. Sorry. I almost made a mistake.\n\nOkay. Margaret, you'll be with Michael. Okay.\n\nAnd Ann P. In the back there. You'll be with Sumit.\n\nOkay. And Marianne, you'll be with David. And Sharon, you'll be with Ann.\n\nAnd Jose, you can be with Mimi. And Mora, Fran, and Michael will be a group. Okay.\n\nThank you. That's everyone, right?"
