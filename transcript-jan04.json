(3x)\n\nGENERATING BODHICHITTA\n\nThrough the virtues I collect by giving and other perfections,\nMay I become a Buddha for the benefit of all. (3x)\n\nGENERATING THE FOUR IMMEASURABLES\n\nMay everyone be happy,\nMay everyone be free from misery,\nMay no one ever be separated from their happiness,\nMay everyone have equanimity, free from hatred and attachment.\n\nVISUALIZING THE FIELD FOR ACCUMULATING MERIT\n\nIn the space before me is the living Buddha Shakyamuni surrounded by all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, like the full moon surrounded by stars.\n\nPRAYER OF SEVEN LIMBS\n\nWith my body, speech and mind, humbly I prostrate,\nAnd make offerings both set out and imagined.\nI confess my wrong deeds from all time,\nAnd rejoice in the virtues of all.\nPlease stay until samsara ceases,\nAnd turn the Wheel of Dharma for us.\nI dedicate all virtues to great enlightenment.\n\nOFFERING THE MANDALA\n\nThe ground sprinkled with perfume and spread with flowers,\nThe Great Mountain, four lands, sun and moon,\nSeen as a Buddha Land and offered thus,\nMay all beings enjoy such Pure Lands.\n\nI offer without any sense of loss\nThe objects that give rise to my attachment, hatred and confusion,\nMy friends, enemies and strangers, our bodies and enjoyments;\nPlease accept these and bless me to be released directly from the three poisons.\n\nIDAM GURU RATNA MANDALAKAM NIRYATAYAMI\n\nPRAYER OF THE STAGES OF THE PATH\n\nThe path begins with strong reliance\nOn my kind Teacher, source of all good;\nO Bless me with this understanding\nTo follow him with great devotion.\n\nThis human life with all its freedoms,\nExtremely rare, with so much meaning;\nO Bless me with this understanding\nAll day and night to seize its essence.\n\nMy body, like a water bubble,\nDecays and dies so very quickly;\nAfter death come results of karma,\nJust like the shadow of a body.\n\nWith this firm knowledge and remembrance\nBless me to be extremely cautious,\nAlways avoiding harmful actions\nAnd gathering abundant virtue.\n\nSamsara's pleasures are deceptive,\nGive no contentment, only torment;\nSo please bless me to strive sincerely\nTo gain the bliss of perfect freedom.\n\nO Bless me so that from this pure thought\nCome mindfulness and greatest caution,\nTo keep as my essential practice\nThe doctrine's root, the Pratimoksha.\n\nJust like myself all my kind mothers\nAre drowning in samsara's ocean;\nO So that I may soon release them,\nBless me to train in bodhichitta.\n\nBut I cannot become a Buddha\nBy this alone without three ethics;\nSo bless me with the strength to practice\nThe Bodhisattva's ordination.\n\nBy pacifying my distractions\nAnd analyzing perfect meanings,\nBless me to quickly gain the union\nOf special insight and quiescence.\n\nWhen I become a pure container\nThrough common paths, bless me to enter\nThe essence practice of good fortune,\nThe supreme vehicle, Vajrayana.\n\nThe two attainments both depend on\nMy sacred vows and my commitments;\nBless me to understand this clearly\nAnd keep them at the cost of my life.\n\nBy constant practice in four sessions,\nThe way explained by holy Teachers,\nO Bless me to gain both the stages,\nWhich are the essence of the Tantras.\n\nMay those who guide me on the good path,\nAnd my companions all have long lives;\nBless me to pacify completely\nAll obstacles, outer and inner.\n\nMay I always find perfect Teachers,\nAnd take delight in holy Dharma,\nAccomplish all grounds and paths swiftly,\nAnd gain the state of Vajradhara.\n\nRECEIVING BLESSINGS AND PURIFYING\n\nFrom the hearts of all the holy beings, streams of light and nectar flow down, granting blessings and purifying."

        "text": "We can meditate on the value of the precious bodhichitta. Go through one or more of the benefits of bodhichitta and really admire it deeply from your heart. We can take any of the ten or others that we know.\n\nFor example, the conquest of all great evils, the attainment of the most sublime happiness, wish fulfillment and so on. Just envision or imagine what this mind of bodhichitta is like and then admire it based on one or more of these benefits. If through this admiring faith a mind of wishing faith develops, we just hold that single pointedly deep in our heart.\n\nThrough the development of bodhichitta we will become a Buddha, especially with an ability to help and protect those who we made dedications to benefit. We'll spend the final few minutes envisioning what this will look like, what it will be like when we become a Buddha, how that will help those in our life and world to see the incredible beauty of this. Then in our own time we can gradually arise from our practice."

One, sometimes I miss the last session because I just fall asleep, but then I'll remember it in my dream, so that's cool, or in the middle of the night, so it's still there, I still feel connected, which is really nice.\n\nAnd then this other shift that just happened this week is that I feel like I'm starting to plan my days based on my six sessions versus the opposite, where I'm like, I used to try to squeeze things in, but now it's like, well, the most important thing is for me to do these six sessions. Who cares about whatever else happens or not? But it doesn't matter.\n\nIt's actually not a sacrifice. I get everything done, but if I prioritize the six sessions, then it feels like, oh, cool, there's this shift where my life is all about dharma. So I really hope when I'm getting to day 30, and then I think I'm going to stop with the little notebook and see, but I don't want to go back.\n\nThat's my learning."

        "text": "Fantastic, Ajana. Thank you. That's sort of the intention, is these six sessions become, at first, they're like little dharma outposts in our mind.\n\nIf our mind is like the wilderness or something like that, they're like little dharma outposts. Imagine you're exploring the wilderness. At first, you just set up these little rickety, crusty outposts with a little fence and some defenses around and whatever.\n\nBut over time, you start to trade from there, and there's people who live there full time, and they build up little houses, and they build better little barricades. At some point, they become like little cities, self-sustaining cities. Maybe they all become interconnected, all these outposts.\n\nIt's a little bit like that. At first, the six sessions, our mind is like this unruly wilderness with a bunch of jackals and nasty things running around. We're trying to set up our little practice and little outposts, and we're getting absolutely massacred.\n\nBut over time, through doing it regularly, we build up some fortification around it. At some point, they become self-sustaining, and the end result being our dharma minds pervade our whole day, our whole life. So it's just an artificial structure at first, but it's an artificial structure that eventually becomes kind of ingrained, as you said.\n\nWe'll even start thinking about our day around the six sessions instead of trying to cram them in, which is amazing. Eventually, it will be ten sessions and a never-ending session, which is the ultimate kind of goal. Yes, it was wonderful, Adriana.\n\nThank you very much. I appreciate your example of having that kind of discipline and structure, writing it down as a tool to help it eventually become kind of self-sustaining on its own. Okay?\n\nOthers, please? Anything else out in the world? Let's meet."

        "text": "Okay, so going back to previous classes, you'd been talking about with bodhicitta, first you said this kind of like, well, I took it as relaxing, but you're like, no, it's not about having \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if you have the mind of bodhicitta, you can be relaxed, and then you kind of gave this refinement about being peaceful. So I've been reflecting on that a lot, about like, if I have the mind of bodhicitta, I can be peaceful. And so the way I've sort of like worked with that is that like I have to really be doing something.\n\nRight? Otherwise it's just like I'm kind of lying to myself. And so what I was struggling with was like I often feel like there's some \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it seems like there's something to do.\n\nYeah, nothing virtuous to do in certain situations, which I want to \u00e2\u20ac\u201c some issue I want to like make better, and I'm like, oh, well, what can I do? And then that \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and then if there's nothing I can do, I have a hard time feeling peaceful about it. But I guess my thing now is that like, well, I can just do anything and dedicate towards it.\n\nJust kind of like with purification, it's like the power of opponent force can be anything. Like if I want to purify me insulting someone, I could prostrate to Buddha and dedicate towards it. And so I think I'm going to like really try to get into this idea of like just maybe it's a prostration, maybe it's some sort of offering, all sorts of things, of just using those practices and really dedicating it towards these bodhicitta aims.\n\nAnd that way I feel like I'm doing something, and I can then feel peaceful."

        "text": "Yeah, that's amazing, Sumi. Thank you so much for sharing that. Yeah, so it's like kind of moving out of that, like the sort of naive understanding that we have of like benefiting others, which is sort of physically doing something for someone, which often has backfires, and there's no guarantee that it's of any use, physically doing something for someone, into more of like a spiritual mindset, right, which is I'm going to do something virtuous on their behalf, dedicating it towards them, and wishing for them happiness. Yeah, which is like a non-deceptive way to help.\n\nI remember not too long ago, a sangha friend of mine who has very little, and I know her and her family. She's got two kids, and she's got like almost no money. It was her kid's 18th birthday.\n\nAnd I said, oh, I'd love to send you some money, you know, just like so you can celebrate with her, you know, and some substantial amount, enough that would be nice, you know, a nice gift. And she said to me, she said, you know, I think what would be best is if you just pray for us. That's non-deceptive help.\n\nAnd I was very touched. Like they have like nothing, you know. They have almost like nothing, but they're very balanced, you know.\n\nAnd she was like teaching me something there. And I thought that was very interesting. Like she really just wanted my prayers.\n\nAnyway, I just touched. I was like, okay, I have to improve. Thank you for the teaching.\n\nAnyway, yeah, it's nice. Thank you. Thanks to me.\n\nFran, yes."

        "text": "So I've been very grateful for my six sessions for the past couple of weeks. I'm living with some, I'm out of town in California living with some cousins who are having health issues and they need me here to drive them and whatever. They need me to be here for about three weeks living with them in close quarters.\n\nAnd my intention when I came here was, oh, I'm going to have all the spare time and I'm going to meditate and I'm going to read and I'm going to practice and I'm going to study the best of intentions. And that's not what has happened. And I feel very disconnected from the world and very disconnected from anything.\n\nAnd I was going to say disconnected from reality, but that's obvious. But my six sessions has been my steadfastness. And I've stopped, I've learned over time to not beat myself up for not having, not doing more because I have the time to do more.\n\nThis is what is keeping me focused and tethered to the Dharma and to all of you and to everybody. So I'm very, very grateful for that. And I have maintained that except for one day when I fell asleep before my sixth session.\n\nBut I was even thinking yesterday, I was like, oh, maybe I won't go to class. I just got to, you know, I just feel like I don't belong right now. And I'll listen to the recording.\n\nBut here I am. So that's been very helpful. I'm curious about something that Sumit said.\n\nAnd because it's something that I've been thinking about. So we want our bodhicitta to become spontaneous. To not be something that we're planning and saying, okay, I've done this.\n\nThis is my intention to benefit all living beings and dedicate it. And then, but we want it to just be natural. Is there a window for dedication?\n\nI know because I'll do something that I'll say, it'll be, all right, I really want to do this to benefit somebody and then I'll dedicate it. But if it's becoming sort of a natural thing to just do the right thing and help people along the way. And I don't realize until like the end of the day that I've done.\n\nOh, yeah, that was a pretty virtuous thing that I did. Can I bring it to mind and still dedicate it? Or is there, is that moment lost once the action is completed?"

        "text": "Yeah, so we can dedicate any time as long as we haven't destroyed that merit through anger. So dedicate it two billion years later if we didn't get angry over those two billion years. It's just, that's the issue is that often our anger destroys the merit.\n\nBut yeah, there's, it's a great practice to do. And we can even just sort of, just that act of kind of trawling through the virtuous actions of the day. And kind of like collecting them and making a dedication at the end of the day.\n\nIt's just very beneficial psychologically. Regardless of whether our anger has destroyed some of the potency of those actions. Because we're kind of like rejoicing and admiring all the virtue we've engaged in.\n\nAnd really taking note of that. And at the very least we can dedicate that rejoicing and positivity we've created. So that kind of end of the day check in mass dedication practice is a very useful thing.\n\nEspecially to fold into that last session of the day. It's a kind of famous way of practicing for many Buddhists."

        "text": "Thanks so much Fran. And also just thanks for showing that example of like when we set up these six sessions. It's really moving us towards being like a mahasiddha.\n\nLike someone who's deeply practicing in daily life. Because we start to break down this divide between a seated practice and being a bodhisattva or a Buddha in daily life. We start breaking down this sort of sense of a divide.\n\nWhich is just a false binary. There's not actually a divide between the seated practice and practicing in daily life. We're just using our mind.\n\nIt's just harder to be focused in daily life often. But for some people it's harder to be focused on a cushion than it is to be focused out and about. So the more we practice these, and remember it kind of gets rid of this strange, I don't know, kind of mythological quality to the seated practice.\n\nAnd we just realize meditation is designed for all the time. All the time. That's how we're going to be a Buddha.\n\nIf our mind can be in a meditative space all the time. So once we can set these up, it just starts to pervade our day. And we don't need to be so rigid about some kind of elaborate, formal thing.\n\nWe might find that time because we love it, and we just want a little quiet. But it's not because we're trying to check some box off. It's just because we're just loving it.\n\nAnyway, thanks so much, Fran. Others, please? Reports from the field?\n\nMarianne, yes.

I don't know. My mind is like a mess.\n\nSo it's just not. I just can't keep track, really, of it. So I may try the notebook.\n\nI set an alarm on my phone, but it didn't really work.

You can even do it like six times at the end of the day, if that's how the day goes. Sometimes that's all we got in us.\n\nYeah.

And then I come back and I look at my little booklet because I have a little booklet. I've got, you know, from eight in the morning to nine at night.\n\nAnd then I feel bad. Oh, look, you missed one. You missed this.\n\nSo I don't want to feel bad. The whole point is I don't want to feel bad. So I put in the space where I normally put a checkmark.\n\nI put a G in there because my whole feeling right now in meditation is to feel gratitude. So by bringing up the G and remembering I have a lot of gratitude in my life for a lot of things, past, present, that make it like closes the book on feeling bad. Because when you have gratitude, you can't feel bad or it's harder for me to feel bad.\n\nSo that's one thing. The second thing is I am looking for opportunities to help people. And so I found myself today with a friend who has surgery tomorrow.\n\nNot serious surgery, but surgery. And she was getting bummed out. The loss of people she's had in her life.\n\nAnd, you know, what Marianne said, the weather, it's dark, it's cold, it's gray, whatever. So we met for coffee. And she likes to talk.\n\nGood. So I felt myself sitting there just trying to just zip my mouth and just let her talk because I felt like that's what she needed. And I felt, to be honest, some sort of impatience coming up in me a little bit, feeling like, oh.\n\nYou know, and trying to stay with her through some of these long tire jobs she's going through. And after that, I kind of worried a little bit about, wait a minute, did I just you know, here's a good thing I'm trying to do for a friend. And she was very happy and grateful.\n\nIt seemed that I did that. But now I'm thinking, did I did I just, you know. Negate that by the impatience I was feeling."

So you had a method to deal with the sort of guilt that would set in from not doing the session, which is like, yeah, we don't need to feel that way ever.\n\nAnd so you just feel gratitude instead. And then trying to help a friend and noticed, oops, a little judgmental mind, you know, setting in, impatient mind setting in. Yeah, in these situations, that experience is very useful.\n\nIf we're not engaging with people where we're feeling that way sometimes, we're probably not pushing ourselves a little bit to grow our love. Because we need to hang out with people that we find annoying and frustrating. How are we going to grow our love if we only hang out with the people that are easy to hang out with all the time?\n\nSo it's not a problem, actually, that you felt that way. It's actually, I think it's good because you're pushing yourself out of the comfort zone to spend time with this person. But what we want to do is then use that and go, okay, this is great.\n\nThis is showing me kind of how conditional my love is. And this is actually really, really useful. Okay, this person is like a teacher for me.\n\nNext time I see them, I'm ready for the long, meandering stories. I hope it just keeps going on. And I'm going to outlast them.\n\nI'm going to just stay with that person until they give up. Because I'm just going to be there with them. And we can just use this as a really nice challenge, actually.\n\nSo as bodhisattvas, we're training bodhisattvas, we need to be in situations like this regularly, where we're expanding our love outward, outward, outward to more and more, even very difficult people. Yeah, so a little bit of discomfort is quite a good thing in our relationships. It's very, very useful.\n\nYeah, thank you."

And I've been really thinking about some of the elements that Sumit brought into that teaching. And it's just been really, really lovely.\n\nBut usually after an empowerment, for me at least, my experience is that my heart just opens. It just opens really wide. And all day after, on Friday, I felt really soft.\n\nAnd almost like really tearful too. And I was like, oh gosh, like one little push and I'm just going to have like a tsunami of tears, you know. And so luckily it was very quiet in the office and stuff.\n\nBut on Friday night, I had to do meditation at the center. And I was like, oh gosh, I'm going to just be like teaching the meditation. I'm going to cry, you know.\n\nSo I walk into the center and my guys are there. And I'm like, listen guys, you know, I just want to warn you that I'm feeling very weepy. And they're like, it's okay Mimi, no worries.\n\nAnd I was like, okay, let's do this. And it just so happened that I had planned the meditation to be on Bodhicitta. So I, you know, I led the meditation.\n\nAnd then in the meditation, like I felt this complete and total calmness. Just calmness. It was as if like something just came in my mind and it was like hush.\n\nAnd when I came out of the meditation, like all that feeling of like wanting to cry and stuff was gone. And I was like, oh, meditation is just so healing. But like, why was I surprised?\n\nI was like, duh. But it was just, yeah, very special and very beautiful. That's my share."

        "text": "Yeah, thanks Mimi. Yeah, I'm so glad that the entire event was so meaningful and touched you. And yeah, I think, yeah, this experience, right?\n\nOf teaching on Bodhicitta and then doing the meditation and finding it very healing. It's kind of an interesting thing because often when we teach something, we get a special blessing. Part of it is for the people who are there.\n\nLike, we get a blessing because we're the one transmitting the teaching to the people who are there. So it's like the Buddhas are trying to give the teaching to the people who are there. But we're the vessel.\n\nAnd so because we're the vessel, it's like Buddhas are working through us. And so we get a special blessing. And so, even guiding the meditation, we can get that kind of blessing.\n\nBecause there's sort of this conduit for the Buddhas, the people who are there. So this is one of the very special benefits of teaching Dharma. The analogy I always kind of give is like, the people who come, they're sort of like at the end of a river.\n\nAnd they're enjoying the water that's flowing from that river. That's like the blessings and inspiration. And the Buddhas are like the sort of waterfall that's pouring down, like the source of all that water.\n\nAnd we're kind of like the banks of that river. It's like our mind. Because we're sort of like the funnel for that water to flow to those people.\n\nAnd so like the banks of the river, they're nourished by the water pouring through. It's like the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East, where a lot of modern civilization came from. It's from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.\n\nAnd these rivers pouring through, they made the areas around very fertile and beautiful and lush. So it's kind of the same thing. It's like, from one point of view, yeah, it's just the Buddhas, that's the waterfall.\n\nAnd there's the people at the bottom, getting the benefit of that water. They're like nourished by it. But because we're this sort of conduit, we're getting nurtured also, through those blessings pouring through us, for the people there.\n\nAnd so anyway, it's just a kind of thing to ponder a little bit. And it helps us start to see one of the benefits of teaching Dharma. Because, anyway, we'll find this more and more over time.\n\nI find when I'm preparing for a big event or something, I'll get blessings around that topic that I don't get normally. And it's only because of the people who are coming, that I'm getting those blessings. Because the Buddhas are trying to help them.\n\nAnd they're like, well, I've got to put up with you. You're the conduit, so I guess, you're the one who's going to be saying it, so I guess that's fine. And so you get these little blessings about that topic.\n\nAnd so you benefit, obviously, because those give some insights. People benefit because they get them. So anyway, it just helps us see the usefulness of teaching.\n\nThanks so much. Last one, Suzanne. Yes, please."

And it was too late to do anything about it except for freak out.\n\nAnd basically, I was trying to think, what can I do in the moment to help? Tying back to what you were saying at the beginning of class. And in the moment, I just took some deep breaths.\n\nAnd I was like, all right, you know, there's nothing much I could do right now. And then I thought about it more, and I'm like, what would a Buddha do? A Buddha wouldn't care because a Buddha doesn't have any problems.\n\nAnd I started thinking about that. And I'm like, but this could really be a potential problem and a costly one. So Carl came over and distracted me.\n\nAnd I was still upset the next morning. And I did my mantras. I did my meditation.\n\nAnd then I did the workshop, the Saturday workshop. And I felt so much better. I'm like, it really doesn't matter what happens.\n\nEither way, it's going to be okay. It really doesn't matter. So it wasn't right in the moment.\n\nIt took me a little while to get there. But hopefully, I can continue doing things like this with my mind."

        "text": "Yeah, thank you, Suzanne. Yeah, it's a nice illustration, right, how problems are just painful feelings, right? And we always have to come back to that teaching.\n\nEven though it's sort of a quote-unquote basic teaching, it's incredibly profound. And if we lived it perfectly, we'd be very close to being a liberated being, right? Problems are just unhappy feelings in our minds.\n\nThat's it. You know, we know the car's problem isn't our problem, etc., right? And so it's like sometimes, though, we have to kind of go through a feeling like, no, the bill or whatever it is, that's the real problem.\n\nAh! We freak out a little bit. And we practice Dharma.\n\nAnd at some point, the inner problem changes. And we see, ah, okay, I can relax. And then as you kind of demonstrated, there's always that solution, but hopefully over time, right, we can become more and more fluent with that understanding so that we can a little bit expedite the process and really feel, ah, my only problem is the unpleasant feeling in my mind.\n\nI can solve that actually strictly through Dharma practice. Other than that, there's no problem. Yeah, thank you.\n\nOkay, let's take a look at the book. Thanks, everyone, for the lovely data. Okay, so I think we are at recognizing bodhicitta.\n\nPage 30. Krishna says here, recognizing bodhicitta. This has three parts.\n\nThe divisions of bodhicitta. The benefits of the aspiring mind of bodhicitta. The benefits of the engaging mind of bodhicitta.\n\nThe divisions of bodhicitta. If our meditation on bodhicitta is to be successful, we need to understand exactly what the essence of this mind is. As already stated, bodhicitta is a spontaneous and continuous state of mind that seeks enlightenment solely for the benefit of all sentient beings.\n\nOkay, so solely is the thing that we've got to particularly work at. Yeah, that's quite, that's implying no self-grasping, no self-cherishing at all. Or at least definitely no self-cherishing, which is hard to do with any substantial self-grasping.\n\nSometimes it's helpful, right, to take your name. So I'm Kyle, so I'll take Kyle. So I think, okay, Kyle doesn't get to become enlightened.\n\nKyle doesn't get to enjoy the fruits of enlightenment. I'm only becoming enlightened for others. And it's a useful thing to kind of meditate on, because what we're trying to do is get the sense of solely.\n\nLike for example, what would it be like to be motivated solely for the benefit of others? Like zero self-concern. Zero self-interest.\n\nNot 0.1%, not 10% self-interest. Not a little me, a little you, a little tit-for-tat or something like that. Not like that at all.\n\nLike solely for the benefit of others. Right? Zero self-interest.\n\nYou know, what's that exactly like? To think like, I will not get to enjoy the benefits of enlightenment at all. At least the self we normally see.\n\nObviously we won't, because we're going to let go of that. Do I still want to become enlightened? I was like, actually, no.\n\nI want to enjoy the fruits. Me, me, me. I don't want to do it just for them.\n\nAll those measly people out there. So this is one thing we want to work on in our life. Weaning ourselves off of self-interest.\n\nSo it's like taking the activities in our life, and what's it like to kind of reduce the self-interest in the different things that we do. We can't go from 100% to 0% instantly. It's like 100% to 99.999%. To 99.98%. It's like that. For example, what's it like to see a friend? Solely for their benefit. No interest at all in our own benefit.\n\nWhat's it like to be with that person? What's it like to spend a day solely in the benefit of others? Zero interest in our own benefit.\n\nSo it's nice just to look at our day, look at the things that we do, and just see how much self-interest is in this. How much self-interest is in that. How much self-interest is in this.\n\nHow much self-interest is in that. Like when we make our coffee in the morning, how much self-interest is there. And then like when we commute to work, how much self-interest is there.\n\nWhen we talk to people, how much self-interest is there. That's a great place to kind of work on it, because it's not that hard to shift the needle a bit, in a conversation at least. Okay, I'm going to reduce my self-interest in this conversation, and be just really present and interested in them, and bring out the best of them.\n\nSo we can kind of go through the day, go through, oh sorry, for our meditation practice, how much self-interest is in there. What's it like to sit down and meditate and think, I don't care at all for this to benefit me. I'm only doing this for other people.\n\nI don't care at all if this makes me feel good. I'm only doing this for others. What would that be like?\n\nWhat would that kind of altruism feel like? And first of course, this is going to be quite mixed, right? The point here is just to start to investigate this idea solely.\n\nBecause the more we think about it, the more we ponder this, I think the more we're going to see how radical this really is. Like how radical Buddhahood is. You know, there's like, yeah, anyway.\n\nSolely, that's the point, solely. So let's all ponder this a little bit. Shantideva says that this mind is of two types, aspiring bodhichitta and engaging bodhichitta.\n\nTo understand the significance of, and the distinctions between these two types of mind, it's helpful to be familiar with the traditional methods of cultivating bodhichitta. Totally. Bodhichitta can be developed by following either of two methods.\n\nOne, the sevenfold cause and effect instructions, or two, equalizing and exchanging self with others. The first method was originally taught by Buddha Shakyamuni, and subsequently passed through Maitreya and Asanga, in an unbroken lineage, to such masters as Salimpa and Datisha. The second method, equalizing and exchanging self with others, was designed specifically for those of sharp intelligence.\n\nOh yeah, that must be us. We're like, okay, now we're talking. Yes, I'm one of those, obviously.\n\nLet me skip this part. I'm only in the sharp intelligence crew, you know. It was also taught by Buddha Shakyamuni and passed to Manjushri, in an unbroken lineage of India masters to Shantideva himself.\n\nBoth lineages have survived to the present day, and are currently held by accomplished teachers of all traditions of Mahayana Buddhism. Equalizing and exchanging self with others will be explained at length in the eighth chapter. What follows is an explanation of developing bodhicitta by means of meditating on the sevenfold cause and effect instructions.\n\nThis method flourished widely throughout India and Tibet, and by studying it, we will see that bodhicitta is not something that can be attained instantly, but rather is the result of a gradual training and development of the mind. Okay, so the Lam Rim instructions are the particular example where these two lineages are combined. You'll notice that most of the seven, of the sevenfold cause and effect, are kind of explicitly separate Lam Rim meditations.\n\nEquanimity, kindness of others, etc. And then the equalizing and exchanging meditations are in the Lam Rim too. So this is one of the insights that Atisha had, was actually that they both have strengths, both lineages, and so he put the sevenfold cause and effect lineage plus the equalizing and exchanging self lineage, which you call kind of like a wisdom, kind of like wisdom lineage and kind of like method lineage, and put these two together into the Lam Rim.\n\nIt's like one kind of sequence. So this is one of the kind of insights that Atisha had, is that they both have strengths, and they're complementary, they're not particularly separate practices, and that we can kind of, by practicing together, they bring a lot of benefit.

        "text": "Yeah, here it means wisdom, but the word intelligence is used, or sharp intelligence. So intelligence is just like knowing about stuff. It could be knowing about material things, it could be knowing about how to make things or put things together, or engage in some kind of verbal exposition, or how to deceive others, or how to make bombs, or whatever.\n\nThis is just sort of what we mean normally by intelligence. Wisdom is virtuous intelligence, so it means understanding what leads to happiness and what leads to suffering, and what are the causes of happiness, what are the causes of suffering, and how to kind of grow. So, the cause of happiness, and how to reduce the cause of suffering.\n\nSo, yeah, it's helpful basically just to think, like wisdom is understanding, it's basically understanding the Four Noble Truths. The technical definition is a virtuous, intelligent mind that understands meaningful objects and functions to dispel diluted doubts. Meaningful objects means any of the objects of the Four Noble Truths.\n\nWhy? Because the Four Noble Truths, they combine all of Buddha's teachings, which are the ways to make our life meaningful, but also because the Four Noble Truths can be kind of rephrased as suffering and its, understanding suffering and its causes, understanding liberation and its causes. That's basically what the Four Meditations refer to, which is all you need to know to be a Buddha.\n\nWhy we suffer, and what that suffering is, how we can be liberated, and what's the path to liberation. So, wisdom is kind of understanding that. Does that make sense?\n\nYeah. The reason this phrase, sharp intelligence, is used here, and it's really referring to wisdom, it's just because part of the equalizing, exchanging self with others lineage is based on understanding the emptiness of the self. That's where you don't need to understand the emptiness of the self particularly to benefit from the sevenfold cause and effect method.\n\nYou can kind of do it, sans any emptiness, which is one of its strengths. And for some people that's their way in, because maybe the teachings on emptiness are a little bit challenging in some ways. Equalizing, exchanging self with others will be explained at length in the eighth chapter.\n\nI remember when I first read this book, it was the first Dharma book I got. I skipped at that point when I read that. I went, I'm one of those people, obviously.\n\nSharp intelligence. Skip, skip, skip. And then I read it and I thought, yeah, I don't understand this at all.\n\nI'm coming back. I'm coming back to page 31. Thank you.\n\nBut it's skillful, I guess, just kind of saying, hint, hint. Jump ahead if you'd like. Give it a shot.\n\nWhat follows is an explanation of developing bodhicitta by means of meditating on the sevenfold cause and effect instructions. This method flourished widely throughout India and Tibet. And by studying it, we'll see that bodhicitta is not something...\n\nOh yeah, I already read all this. The sevenfold cause and effect is a method involving the successive development of seven realizations as follows. Recognizing that all living beings are mothers, remembering the kindness of all mother beings, developing the wish to repay the kindness of all mother beings, developing affectionate love, developing great compassion, developing superior intention, developing bodhicitta.\n\nEquanimity is secret. Meditation, zero. This method is called the sevenfold cause and effect because these seven realizations are a chain of cause and effect leading to the final realization of bodhicitta.\n\nFor example, the realization of affectionate love acts as a cause for developing great compassion. Before we begin our meditation on the sevenfold cause and effect, it's helpful first of all to meditate on equanimity. At present, our mind is unsettled and biased.\n\nInstead of looking at all beings equally with the eye of compassion, we feel very close towards some and very distant from or even hostile towards others. In such an unbalanced state, it is very difficult to recognize all beings as our mothers, the first of the seven cause and effect realizations. Therefore, if our meditation is to be successful, we must first try to remove our prejudices by cultivating an attitude of equanimity.\n\nIt's helpful to start to dig into what are our biases around people. I prefer this kind of person and not that kind of person. It can be kind of just straightforward ones and it can be even ugly and unpleasant biases that maybe we wouldn't publicly announce.\n\nWe wouldn't say because it's a bit uncouth or nasty. Something a little bit we're not proud of. Most people, unless you've trained in perfect equanimity, have biases of some sort.\n\nWe prefer a certain kind of person over another kind of person. Even if we don't know anything about them, just based on even superficial things. We have these kind of prejudices.\n\nIt's helpful to look at that. Even as you walk down the street, just going like, who do we like? Who do we not like?\n\nWho do we not care about? Just sort of say, I'm kind of instantaneously preferring people and kind of projecting my prejudices on the people I know nothing about. How intriguing.\n\nWe kind of want to dig into this a little bit in our own mind. Why do we have these biases? Why do we prefer this kind of person over that kind of person?\n\nWhat are the sort of dividing lines our mind makes? Is it around gender? Ethnicity?\n\nClass? Nationality? Religion?\n\nBehavior? Hobbies? Whatever.\n\nWhat's the sort of lines that we make in the sand about the people we prefer and the people we don't prefer? We want to look at these, because we're trying to become a Bodhisattva, a friend of the world. We want this feeling of when we look out at people, for example, the people that come to the Dharma Center, or the people that we walk by on the street.\n\nLater, there's the analogy given, it's like looking at the beautiful blue sky. You don't think that part of the blue sky is better than this part of the blue sky. You just feel like, that's beautiful, and that's beautiful.\n\nYou feel equal towards each. That's what we want to get to. What would that be like, to really feel that way?\n\nEspecially as Dharma teachers, training Dharma teachers. We never want to have favorites of anyone who comes to the meditation center. We don't want to prefer.\n\nOh, I like this person. They agree with me a lot. They ask good questions.\n\nThey say to me how great I am a lot. I prefer them over that person who shouts out in the middle of class, or passes out the whole time, and snores, and disrupts everyone, and gets up 8 times to go to the bathroom, or greedily just eats all the snacks afterwards, and throws them everywhere. We don't want to have favorites, but obviously our mind is going to be a bit biased to prefer the people who massage our ego more than the other people.\n\nWhich is unfortunate, but that's just natural. But we want to oppose that. We don't want to have that kind of attitude.\n\nSo anyway, from a practical point of view, let's start looking at these. What are these dividing lines that come from our mind, where we prefer this kind of person, or that kind of person, or the people we think, I don't like that kind of person, or I really do like that kind of person. What are those for us, and how can we start chiseling away at them?\n\nWe're going to take a break in a second, but one of the simplest things that I do, that helps me a lot with my equanimity, I've got a long way to go, but this helps me a lot personally, is to focus on people's very subtle mind, or their root mind, which is like their Buddha nature, but it's something very specific. It's kind of thinking, okay, it's the very subtle mind, that's the real mind for someone. That's people's real mind.\n\nFor me, I find this very helpful. If I try to focus on this when I meet people, and I just focus on their very subtle mind, the root mind, then it starts to feel like everyone's quite equal, because it's when we get a little bit too stuck in the physicality that makes people seem quite a bit different, just because we grasp a lot of physicality, and it's part of our physicality to do that, right? It's kind of like our little monkey coding, you know, in these bodies, to care so much about the physicality and physical differences.\n\nBut if we can kind of move from the physical, and to think physical is just like a sheath, it's like something completely ephemeral. That's actually not related to that person at all. They've had billions of bodies.\n\nAs Geshe-la says, our bodies, if they were piled together, they'd be greater than Mount Meru, bigger than Mount Everest, all the bodies we've had. We've done all sorts of beings, cockroaches and butterflies and formless beings and hell beings and so on. So the body has nothing to do with who that person really is.\n\nSo sometimes just looking past that to the mind, the very subtle mind, I feel like that's like the real mind. And the very subtle body, which is linked to the very subtle mind, which is also called the very subtle wind, that's like the real body. If we can kind of move our mind to that, it just starts to feel like everyone's a bit equal.\n\nAnd sometimes you can even like, if you're grumbling about someone, let's say, and you're sitting on your couch, so you just close your eyes, and you just throw the body away, and then try to get mad at their very subtle mind. The root mind. Just think like that's kind of who they really are.\n\nThere's no body, there's just a little very subtle mind floating about. And try to grumble about that. And for me, when I do this, it's just it's hard to get mad at a mind, you know, and the very subtle wind.\n\nIt's hard to get mad at their Buddha nature, right? So anyway, this is just one idea of how we can start to mine equanimity. There's the traditional way, which we'll look at, but there's also some other ways in that we can kind of approach the meditation.\n\nAnd it's good to have a little bit of a toolbox approach to this meditation, because it's so foundational for our love. And we need a few kind of strategies that will work for us. So anyway, try this out.\n\nThis is an amazing meditation. It's just so fun. It's so delightful.\n\nAnd it makes, it has a lot of other kind of systemically positive effects for our mind in other meditations. Okay, let's take a little breather now. Just a heads up, next or this coming Saturday, we have our first annual Vajrayogini Day bonanza party.\n\nSo we'll have a quick pass of sog, and we'll just feel very delighted. It's like most sort of holy day in the Kadampa calendar. That and the 25th of January.\n\nSo these two days are like uniquely kind of special days. So we're going to celebrate in style. So that's this Saturday.\n\nSo come along if you'd like, and celebrate with us. Okay, we'll dedicate now, and we'll come back at 6.09. Thank you. Again, thank you for the virtues we've collected through practicing, meditating, discussing.\n\nMay all living beings find lasting peace of mind, enlightenment."

        "text": "Spend a couple of minutes investigating or imagining what it would be like to wish to become enlightened solely for the benefit of others, with absolutely no self-interest. Let's see if we can really picture and feel what this is like, with no interest at all in what we'll get out of it. And then in our own time, we can gradually arise from our practice.\n\nOkay, so we'll continue looking at equanimity. So we looked at one strategy, which is to focus on people's very subtle wind and mind. Their real body and mind.\n\nNext. This is more the traditional way. Briefly outlined, this is page 32, Briefly outlined, the way to develop equanimity is as follows.\n\nFirst we should bring to mind three people we presently regard as our enemy, our friend, and a stranger. Then we should ask ourselves why we've categorized them in this way. That's a great question.\n\nI was asking, why am I categorizing this person in this way? Why? Upon inspection, we will find that the person we now call our enemy has received this label because of some harm, great or small, mental or physical, real or imagined.\n\nThey've given us in the past. If we think back, however, we can often remember occasions when this same person treated us with much kindness. If we could see into our past lives, as will be discussed later, we would undoubtedly discover instances in which the so-called enemy was our selflessly kind mother, feeding us with her own milk and protecting us from harm and fear.\n\nSo that's a great image. You just take the person you're grumbling about and you imagine them feeding you with their own milk. And you're just a little baby.\n\nThat's what happened. So the person that we don't like did that for us. We can imagine.\n\nEven without considering any lifetime but the present, we can see how temporary and easily subject to change the status of an enemy really is. If tomorrow we were to receive some unexpected assistance, praise, or merely a kind word from this person, would we still regard him or her as our foe? There's a lot to unpack here.\n\nOne is just the complete purposelessness of calling someone an enemy. It only functions to disturb our mind. So it's a completely purposeless label.\n\nIt's a pointless label. The only enemy are delusions. So no people are enemies.\n\nAnyone we think of as our enemy, we only think that way because of the delusions in our mind or in their mind. So it's just the delusions that are to blame. It's great just to think, what am I getting out of calling someone an enemy?\n\nBecause often we do it because we get something out of it. It's just not something very healthy. It's quite a maladaptive thing we get out of it.\n\nFor example, a distraction from our own pain. That's why people love obsessing over the news and how much they hate this person or that person in the news or this group or that group in the news. It's because it's an incredibly effective way to escape from your own pain.\n\nIt's a distraction to get away from our own issues and our own problems. It's much easier sometimes to just blame other people and think about how terrible they are than to look at what's going on in our own mind. Anyway, we can ponder this a little bit.\n\nWhat do we actually get out of calling someone an enemy? What is it really doing for us? And the more we probe that, we'll see whatever reason is going on there is completely maladaptive and unhealthy and that it only functions to harm us.\n\nSo just this simple idea, right? Our only enemies are delusions is another way into equanimity. The whole chapter called Enhancing Cherishing Love in Eight Steps to Happiness offers a ton of different strategies that all kind of support equanimity.\n\nAnd that's one of the ones. Another thing here is just to understand, when we're sitting there thinking about someone we don't like, who we're viewing as our enemy, it's helpful to understand what we're thinking about is a generic image of that person. We're not actually thinking about the person themselves.\n\nThe person isn't in our mind. There's a mental image of the person. We're just sitting there.\n\nThe person's not around. What we're engaging with is a mental image. It's like a 2D.\n\nIt's often a 2D or at least just a metaphorically 2D version of the person. It's just some kind of exaggeration that our minds come up with. But even like explicitly Geshe-la explains this in How to Understand the Mind, that whenever we think of anything with a conceptual mind, we're not actually thinking of the thing.\n\nWe're thinking of the generic image of the thing. It's just a mental image. It's a mental projection.\n\nIt's not the thing, which is incredible to ponder, right? Because it's like, oh, I'm mad at my own image of that person. That's actually what I'm mad at.\n\nI'm not mad at the person. I'm mad at my image of the person, which might be completely static and from 20 years ago. It's not even the person who they are now.\n\nIt's like that person is gone often. So it's helpful to just kind of see like, okay, my mind is engaging with everything, actually just through a generic image. It's like a mental image.\n\nIt's like a simplification, you can think of it as. That's how our conceptual minds apprehend anything. And the enemy, particularly, is just this, right?\n\nAnd so we can just think, okay, why did I create, since I'm just getting mad at an image of a person, why am I doing that to myself? Why don't I create a different mental image? This isn't even the person himself.\n\nSo this is another thing that can be helpful. And often we can see how it's often like propaganda, right? It's just, it's not the real picture anyway.\n\nIt's just a completely warped view that's been kind of created in our mind. In addition, there's this bit here. If tomorrow we were to receive some unexpected assistance, praise, or merely a kind word from this person, would we still regard them as our foe?\n\nSo this is a fantastic kind of, it's just like a mental hack. You can apply this to tons of things, right? It's like, what views, opinions, whatever, do we hold?\n\nThat are completely condition-dependent on our life. Basically, if we hold a view or an opinion about something, that would change if the conditions changed. It's not a stable view, right?\n\nWe want to reach a place where we can have views that are condition-independent. Those are like truths. It's like what Dharma is trying to get to.\n\nBasically, no matter the conditions, these views hold to be true. They're impenetrable. People's political views are often like this, right?\n\nTheir views have convenience because they sort of fit their lifestyle and what they like and what they value. But if their lifestyle changed a lot in some significant way, their views might change, actually, politically. Maybe someone has nothing, and they're like, yeah, tax, tax, tax, tax.\n\nTax all those rich people. I hate them. Give me money.\n\nI got nothing. Help me out of here. Then all of a sudden, they start to become rich themselves.\n\nThey go, no, taxes aren't such a good idea, actually. I need that money. I'm going to do good with it, actually.\n\nI'm going to give to charity. Don't take my money. It's like pro-tax, anti-tax.\n\nIt's just condition-dependent. It's like situation-dependent views. It's views of convenience, views of personal convenience.\n\nObviously, a lot of views are like this. We're just looking out for number one. We're looking out for what we care about.\n\nWe're interested in what matters to us. Dharma views, though, are designed, hopefully, to be completely independent of how things go. They're true in the boom times.\n\nThey're true in the bust times, or maybe even more true. That's one of the beautiful things about dharma. Doing something that's an enemy is definitely one of these condition-dependent situations.\n\nSomeone can bribe you at some point and break you. Do enough good, prove themselves enough, that eventually, they're not so bad. Maybe we just see a different side of them.\n\nMaybe we just see their raw suffering and pain, and we develop some real empathy for them. All of a sudden, we don't view them as an enemy anymore. The point here is just, in general, it's great to check any view that we hold tightly on and ask, is there a condition that, if things changed, I would change this view?\n\nAnything that's like that, we think, okay, maybe I shouldn't hold it so tightly. If my life changed, I would change this view. Okay, then I probably shouldn't hold it so tightly.\n\nIt's just a way of navigating the present, the present conditions in my life. Enemies is definitely one of these ones. We can also think, okay, I want to develop views, understandings, that are like a bedrock of truth, that can withstand any condition.\n\nIt's one of the amazing things about Dharma, right? Where it actually becomes more true the more you suffer. The worst things get.\n\nA lot of things break down when life falls apart. Like a lot of ideals and positive thinking and whatever, they fall apart when life falls apart. But actually, the more life falls apart, the more Dharma becomes true.\n\nBecause Dharma is designed for people who understand that life is, samsaric life is birth, aging, sickness, and death. It's pervaded by pain, suffering, and deprecation. Dharma is designed with that in mind.\n\nIt was taught with that in mind. So the more things become difficult, actually, the more it rings true, which is a huge strength of the Dharma. Partially because it's designed to be built on axioms, these fundamental truths.\n\nLike, we're going to die. The Dharma is built on truths like this. Things are impermanent.\n\nInner peace is the real source of happiness. Delusions always lead to suffering. Buddha is setting out these axioms so that we can build up a structure of thought from those truths.\n\nSo because that's how it's built up, it's built up from the ground, from these bedrocks of truth. When things fall apart, when conditions change, when things get better or worse, they still ring true. It's just a beautiful thing to ponder.\n\nWe can ask ourselves, is my Dharma practice built on some bedrocks of truth? There's like a slab of granite that is just like, even if it all fell apart, even if everything burnt to the ground in my life, I would still know these bits are completely true. It's nice to build them up ourselves.\n\nIt's nice to see. The same considerations can be then applied to the person we now call our dear friend. Although the sight, or even the mere thought of him or her now elicits a warm feeling in our heart, this is not always the case.\n\nThere are times either earlier in this lifetime or in previous lives when this dear friend or relative was our chief enemy. I like this phrase, my chief enemy. It's exciting.\n\nAs such, inflicted great suffering upon us. It can easily happen that because of some slight difference of an opinion, hasty word, or thoughtless act, we suddenly find ourselves estranged from the same person to whom we are now so attached. It's just lovely to kind of notice these shifts, right?\n\nFrom enemy to friend. And to like, and to meditate on these examples in our life. Eat either stranger to friend or enemy to friend.\n\nAnd kind of like explore, what happened, what precipitated this change? What allowed this change to happen? And how does it affect my mind?\n\nLike, when I viewed them as enemy, how did that affect me? When I view them as friend now, how does that affect me? What we want to do is kind of get this sense of how malleable these categories are.\n\nAnd also, of course, if we view them in a loving way, every time this happens, we want to take note, and use it as like a data point. These categories are so changeable. In a similar fashion, the stranger has not always been the object of our indifference, nor will he or she always remain so.\n\nThere have been times when this person is so invisible to us now that we may scarcely be aware of his existence, has been our murderous enemy, and other times when he has been our dearest friend and protector. And like, look at the person in the eyes and go, yeah, you were my enemy, my chief enemy before. And then you walk out.\n\nYou should do this. This is a good idea. It's just like, it's helpful to just kind of keep thinking about this kind of thing.\n\nLike, we've had countless relationships with each person. And so, there's actually an incredible depth, a karmic depth, with each relationship. Can you even like imagine, like imagine, you know, there's, what is it, like Groundhog's Day, and all these like sort of little, this like trope, right, of like living the same day over and over and over again.\n\nSo imagine like you did this, but you were like in the grocery store, right, like all you would live over and over, like a thousand times, is like a few hours in this grocery store, right? Like you like walk in, you're there, and you have to be there for like a few hours, then you leave, and then it restarts. And it's like, okay, if you did that like thousands of times, at some point you'd be like, hey, how you doing?\n\nYou know, like, you just start to like look at the people around and be like, hey, what's your like philosophy on life? You know? Or like, hey, you like arugula too?\n\nYou know? And you just like start up a conversation, you'd like make a connection. And you'd like start to like probe, like, the universe is inside these people, right?\n\nThere's this like whole incredible never-ending universe inside each and every person. It's very strange, right, that we just walk around in our little siloed universes, looking at them. It's just like, it's a very kind of unnatural thing to do.\n\nBut I bet if we did that, right, I bet if we lived that grocery store day like 5,000 times or something like that, at some point we would like become best friends with every person in there, at some point. We'd like learn something about them or discover something about them that, you know, was so beautiful that we would admire in them. Anyway, the point is, it's just like inside each person there's so much to be discovered.\n\nThese kind of views, oh, you're this, you're that, they're just like short-sighted, superficial kind of categories that often come from not really knowing someone's heart. By using examples from our own and others' experiences and employing various lines of logical reasoning, we can become convinced that it's extremely short-sighted and ultimately very mistaken to think that anyone is permanently or inherently a friend, enemy, or stranger to us. So inherently is a key word there.\n\nObviously there's no such thing as a friend, enemy, or stranger from their own side because there's nothing from its own side. Everything is just mere name. And if this is the case, if these three positions are so temporary and variable, so justified in generating hatred towards our present enemy, then we should feel obliged to direct this hatred towards everyone.\n\nFor someone in the past we considered, for some time in the past we considered each person our enemy. And if it's correct to feel attached and biased towards our present friends because of some benefit we've received from him or her recently, then we should feel similarly towards everyone because at one time or another everyone has been extremely kind to us, and we should feel the same way there. If we exert enough energy in meditation acquainting ourselves with the above reasons and examples and try to view people in an altered status, we'll come to see how narrow minded it is to be very close to some beings while remaining hostile or indifferent to others.\n\nInstead of assenting, as we do now, to a hard and fast classification of friend, enemy, and stranger and therefore being biased in our outlook, we can develop true equanimity. The basis of our love and compassion necessary if we're to generate the precious bodhicitta and achieve enlightenment. As this is such an extremely worthwhile goal, we should not let our current prejudices go unexamined, but expose them in the manner described.\n\nAt this point, oh, Sumit, yeah, your hand."

        "text": "Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know what you're saying, yeah. Yeah, so how does removing these kind of emotions of attachment and aversion lead to love and closeness instead of indifference?\n\nYeah, this is one of the interesting things is because, and it's a good question, right? And this is a classic kind of question with equanimity meditation. The reason is because when we have attachment and aversion, there's no love there.\n\nWe're using people. We're viewing them as inherently good or inherently bad. So we don't even care about them, actually, when we're attached to them.\n\nThey're just items to be used or items to be rejected. Yeah. So as we wean ourself off of our attachment towards people and our aversion towards people, like real love can actually grow there.\n\nRight? The thing is, for most of us in modern society, those are kind of the options that we live in. We sort of feel like I'm either attached to you or I don't like you.\n\nAnd it feels like those are the options, as if that's like some kind of dichotomy that we have to decide between. Or I guess I don't care about you at all. Which is like kind of a subtle aversion in some way.\n\nIn the Buddhist view, right, is that those aren't the only options. Those are just two different delusions. Aversion, attachment.\n\nAnd if we can wean ourself off of them, then we actually have space to have authentic love for people. Yeah. So it's like as we do this practice, we're thinking how can I get rid of my attachment?\n\nHow can I get rid of my aversion for this person? And then replace those minds with an equally warm and close friendly feeling. Which is like what the mind of equanimity is.\n\nWhich is, it's impossible to actually feel warm and close and friendly if we feel averse or feel attached in that moment. So we have to kind of remove these unbalanced attitudes so that that can set in."

I have to do it from a place of like vigilance and non-attachment but in a way like maybe it seems like a little a bit of a paradox or a contradiction but like having the label as enemy is helpful in this specific case for me because it helps me not be attached to if they like me or not or like attached to getting something out of the relationship like knowing that it's just never going to work out. It's a samsaric relationship so I'm just going to it's like some kind of like ninja or like jujitsu thing I have to do with them to like have self-protection and like kind of guide them in a beneficial way.\n\nDo you think I'm lying to myself?"

Words have no value in and of themselves they're just completely contextual based on what we think they mean right?\n\nSo from like the text point of view we definitely don't want to think that. We don't want to put the category of enemy on anyone on any living being. If what you mean more is just like you understand that you have just little expectations for them to be pleasant and easy then yeah but I would agree I think with that.\n\nThis is where the chapter again on well this is more like in New Eight Steps in transforming adverse conditions but also a bit in Enhancing Cherishing Love where we start to see that these people are like the kindest people to us. So again they're not our enemy they're more just like our mind trainers which isn't really an enemy they're like useful.

        "text": "Yeah so you're saying there might be a positive feeling in the mind when we feel maybe equanimity or warm and close towards someone and there might be a positive feeling in the mind when we're attached to someone. And yeah, this is one of the tricky things about attachment is that there's a good feeling often in the mind of attachment and we like good feelings and so sometimes it's a little bit tricky to discern the difference between the good feeling and the conceptual mind that's operating. So for example when some people meditate on love they actually just end up meditating on the good feeling they generated to the loving mind and they drop the love.\n\nSo let's say they think about the kindness of others that makes them, you get a good feeling along with a conceptual mind of gratitude and love and what's very easy to do is to kind of shift to the good feeling and concentrate on that as the object of meditation. But what ends up happening is you're dropping the conceptual mind of love so then you end up distracted very quickly because you got rid of the thing that's making the good feeling come in the first place. The good feeling in the mind isn't love.\n\nThat's not love. That's just a feeling. So the more we watch our mind, the more we'll start to see there's a difference between the feeling and the state of mind leading to that feeling.\n\nThis is one of the things we need to do to really break the kind of illusion of attachment because the good feeling that comes from it, the good feeling is fine in and of itself, but it makes us not become interested or even aware of the state of mind at play. So in our relationships we're trying to discern what's love, what's attachment. You can't tell by the way someone quote unquote makes you feel.\n\nIt has nothing to do with it actually, whether it's love or attachment. We have to see what's the state of mind going on and the states of mind. There's a simplistic way to think about it is I want you to be happy versus I want you to make me happy.\n\nLove versus attachment. If the good feeling is coming from thinking I want you to be happy, that's love. If the good feeling is coming from us thinking that it's coming from them, then that's attachment.\n\nSo it's sort of like, is the good feeling coming from sort of like, do we think it's coming from within or from without is often the simplest way to think about it. But more precisely, is it coming from the thought I want you to be happy or is it coming from the thought I want you to make me happy or you are making me happy. Yeah, so this is where we have to be scholars a little bit and be clear on what are these definitions of mind and actually start to study our mind quite precisely.\n\nIt's also like faith and attachment are very hard to discern too, right? Like we say, Buddha is the source of all happiness and goodness and our guru is the source of all happiness and goodness. So what's the difference between faith and Buddha and attachment?\n\nBecause attachment is thinking, you're making me happy. It's thinking an inherently existent object is making us happy. But we say Buddha is making us happy.\n\nIsn't that true? So, anyway, sorry, that's a diversion, but these kind of things, we have to think about it and it's actually not that clear at first. And if we think it's crystal, crystal clear and we haven't thought about it deeply, I would say you don't understand the point, which is fine.\n\nOkay, yeah, David, yes, please."

When we're talking about the warm close feeling that comes from love, it means more like, that's speaking more kind of casually, it's like an emotion, a warm closeness, like a cozy closeness to someone.\n\nIt's like you just feel totally comfortable with them.

Everything else is just an ephemeral kind of mirage, like a veil, a sheath, you know, whatever, avatar, you know, of like, it's not really them. It's like, you know, I grew up playing these online computer games where you have little avatars running around and you're interacting with people from India and China and, you know, Germany and France and whatever, and you sort of know, like, that's not them, that little avatar.\n\nYou know, there's like a little person lurking behind a computer screen, you know, somewhere across the world, but you're like, interacting with the avatar, right, the little like, character, you know, but you notice that's not them. So it's a little bit like that. It's not a perfect analogy, but it's okay.\n\nIt kind of gets you to the feeling. Okay, yeah."

I feel there's a little bit of a contradiction because earlier you were talking about, in the context of someone who was going on for a long time, that this is an opportunity for us to expand our love. And I get that, like, oh, I can love this kind of person, I'm that kind of person doing this kind of thing and that kind of thing.\n\nBut that almost makes it seem like they're inherently like that, and I'm just expanding my ability to like all kinds of, or just like, to love all different kinds of people. When that's, when really, all of their faults are projected on them by me, it just seems weird to say, to think like, oh, I'm going to try really hard to love all these different kinds of people when they're not like that at all. It seems very counterproductive to me.\n\nAnd I think that's why it feels very effortful, because to me, I can't develop any kind of love for others without basing it on emptiness. It feels insane."

You're not trying to say like they're inherently that way, but that's how they're appearing to you, right? So you're thinking, okay, I'm gonna train my mind.\n\nThrough training our mind, eventually, we're gonna realize their emptiness, right? We're gonna see them as beautiful, and we're gonna realize, yeah, all the negative things we're seeing in them are just mistaken appearances from my mind. Yeah.\n\nSo I don't see the problem."

I think maybe just to try to make it simple, because this isn't a complicated thing, I think.\n\nI think you're maybe thinking about it more philosophically than like just pragmatically. It just means anyone that we're having an issue with is someone that we're grasping onto as inherently unpleasant in some way. So we've gotta interact with them and work on our mind to break down that sense of their inherent unpleasantness.\n\nAnd it's by interacting with them and learning to love them that allows us to break down that view. It's not saying that's who they are. It's just saying if we stay away from them and run away from them then we're actually making it more real.\n\nWe're reifying it. We're afraid. I don't want to be around them.\n\nThey're so hard to be around. But we're just projecting an inherence on them versus like going in there and going, this is just an illusion. I'm gonna figure out how this is like an illusion coming from my mind.\n\nAnd then we'll love them. Okay. I think that's good for now.\n\nSo I think, yeah, we're just clear. Let's work on our equanimity in some of these different myriad ways. All right.\n\nSo let's have a little time for discussion. Let's see. Let's have how many people we got here?\n\nWe got seven. Okay. So Mary Anne and Anne.\n\nAnd Michael and Maura. And then Sumi and P. And Jose.\n\nOkay. Thank you. ."

And that there's so much more, a whole universal, infinite number of beings behind what we're looking at, and we have no idea what we're looking at. Just the possibilities are, you don't know what's gonna come out of that person.\n\nJust be open to anything."

And each day, this is what I'm gonna do, is make a list of three things that I appreciate about them, like three good things about them.\n\nAnd then we talked about imagining what it would be like to have zero self-interest. We were thinking of this metaphor of making the most beautiful, cozy bed, knowing that we'll never sleep there, that we're gonna sleep in the street, 15-degree weather. We're not gonna do it tonight, but future us will do that as a bodhisattva, right?"

Yeah, so kind of making a list, taking stock of the people that we are viewing as the objects of our aversion in our life, and maybe trying to write down maybe some beautiful things or good things about them, so that we can grow our love for them. And then, yeah, this idea of like playing around with what's it like to reduce my self-interest or even have no self-interest.\n\nYeah, so all these practices are under the guidelines of practicing equanimity. So maybe we can just make it simple and say, we're gonna practice equanimity, but each one of us can kind of bring our own little tools and our toolbox to that practice. Again, with the idea being the aim is an equally warm, close, and friendly feeling towards everyone.\n\nOkay, let's do it. All right, we can just do the prayers of the virtuous tradition. Thank you, everyone."
