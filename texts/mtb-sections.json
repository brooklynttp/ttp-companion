His principal Teacher at that time was a Yogi who had so fully developed penetrating wisdom that it is said he achieved unity with Manjushri, the Buddha embodying the wisdom of all enlightened beings. When Shantivarmana himself engaged in a meditation retreat, he too received a direct vision of Manjushri and many prophetic omens as well."

He told the prince that he should renounce his kingdom and become a celibate monk. Immediately upon waking, Shantivarmana fled the palace and disappeared into the forest to meditate. Once again he received a vision of Manjushri, who handed him a symbolic wooden sword. Upon taking it Shantivarmana attained eight perfect realizations. He then travelled to the great monastic university of Nalanda where he took ordination from the Abbot Jayadeva (God of Victory) and was given the ordination name of Shantideva (God of Peace)."

However, because he did all his practices secretly at night and rested during the day, it appeared to others that he performed only three activities: eating, sleeping and defecating. For this reason, the other monks sarcastically referred to him as the 'Three Realizations'. Feeling he was a very irresponsible monk and a discredit to their illustrious university, they devised a plan to get rid of him. Incorrectly believing him to be deficient in meditational ability and ignorant of doctrinal theory, they arranged for Shantideva to deliver a discourse before the entire monastery. Their idea was that he would be so humiliated by this exposure of his ignorance that he would be shamed into leaving."

As he was expounding the ninth chapter dealing with the wisdom apprehending the true nature of reality he uttered the words, 'Everything is like space.' At this point he began to rise into the sky, flying higher and higher until he could no longer be seen although his voice could still be clearly heard. It was in this miraculous manner that the remainder of the ninth chapter and the entirety of the tenth were delivered."

Needless to say, the monks he left behind were profoundly impressed and somewhat bewildered by Shantideva's teachings and his display of miracle powers. Shortly thereafter a dispute arose about these teachings. The Kashmiri Pandits claimed that Shantideva taught only nine chapters, while some of the scholars from Magadha, who possessed great powers of memorization, argued that he had in fact taught ten. It was decided that the only way to resolve this disagreement would be to hear the teachings once again, so several monks left Nalanda in search of the one they had once despised and requested him to repeat his discourse. This he did, and he also gave them the text of his Compendium of Trainings (Skt. Shikshasamuchchaya), which also explains the practices of a Bodhisattva. From that time onwards the study and practice of Shantideva's works flourished widely throughout India and other Mahayana Buddhist lands."

However, we will not be able to attain this fully awakened state if we do not first develop bodhichitta, the mind of enlightenment. What is bodhichitta? It is the continual and spontaneous state of mind that constantly strives to attain this perfect enlightenment solely for the benefit of all living beings. As will be explained later in this commentary, bodhichitta is developed by training the mind in either of two ways: practising the sevenfold cause and effect meditation (built around the remembrance of motherly love) or exchanging self with others."

This purification of evil is accomplished by exposing our accumulated non-virtue, and then eradicating it by means of the four opponent powers explained in this chapter."

Those who wish to invite this honoured guest into their minds must first acquire a great wealth of positive mental energy. After this is done it is then possible to seize and maintain this precious mind of enlightenment. Therefore, in Chapter Three Shantideva explains how to acquire and hold on to bodhichitta."

His reason for doing so is that giving, or generosity, is part of the general dedication to all living beings of the good and beautiful things in the universe. Therefore Shantideva begins his discussion with what is generally presented as the second of the perfections — the practice of moral discipline — in a chapter entitled 'Guarding the Mind with Alertness'."

Therefore, having the title in Sanskrit helps plant imprints of this holy language on the mind-streams of those reading the text. Secondly, the title is given in the original language to help us recall the great kindness of those who translated the text from Sanskrit into Tibetan.

This tradition stipulated that the translator's homage should indicate to which set or 'basket' (Skt. pitaka) of Buddha's teachings the original Sanskrit text belongs. Thus if a particular text belongs to the set of Vinaya — dealing mainly with the training in higher moral discipline — then the homage should be to the Omniscient One. If it belongs to the Sutra Pitaka — dealing mainly with the training in higher concentration — then homage should be paid to the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. Finally if it is contained within the third set, the Abhidharma Pitaka — dealing mainly with the training in higher wisdom — then homage is paid to youthful Manjughosha, the embodiment of enlightened wisdom. Thus, by reading the homage we can easily tell into which of the three scriptural categories a particular text falls. In this case homage is made to the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas; thus it is clear that Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life belongs to the Sutra Pitaka, the set of discourses mainly concerned with meditative concentration."

In contrast to the overwhelming majority of beings in the universe, including most of our fellow humans, we have the opportunity to do something truly meaningful with our lives. We are free of certain restrictions and in possession of certain abilities and beneficial circumstances that make it possible for us to attain goals far beyond the reach of most beings. But if we do not make use of our present existence in the most worthwhile manner possible, it will be extremely difficult to gain such a beneficially endowed human life again. To appreciate these points more fully we must acquaint ourself with the following detailed analysis."

Every effect has a cause, and our present existence as human beings — and as specially endowed human beings — is the result of a number of specific and hard-to-create causes. In general, birth as a human depends upon having previously practised pure moral discipline and giving. Specifically, each aspect of a fully endowed human life (as described below) has its own appropriate cause. Furthermore, in order to have attained this life we must have generated pure thoughts, or prayers, to receive a bodily vehicle with which we would have the leisure and ability to improve our mind through the continued practice of Dharma, or spiritual teachings. To be effective, such prayers have to be unpolluted by attachment to temporal comforts and happiness. As it is rare that we create even one of these necessary causes, it follows that the fruit resulting from a combination of them all must be extremely rare to find."

As luck would have it he landed on the back of a wild horse grazing below. The horse was so startled that it galloped off with the man holding on for dear life. Quite a long time passed and, to the wonderment of the other villagers, the man showed no signs of tiring of his unusual mount. 'Why don't you get off that horse?' they shouted to him as he raced by. 'Not on your life!' he shouted back to them. 'This is the first time in my life I've ever been on horseback. When can a legless man like me ever hope for such an opportunity again? I'm going to take full advantage of it while I can.' And off he went, clutching on to the back of the wild horse. Just as the man in this story took advantage of his unusual luck, so should we take full advantage of our present fully endowed human life by training our mind in the practice of Dharma."

If we think back, however, we can often remember occasions when this same person treated us with much kindness. And if we could see into our past lives (as will be discussed later) we would undoubtedly discover instances in which this so-called enemy was our selflessly kind mother, feeding us with her own milk and protecting us from harm and fear. Even without considering any lifetime but the present, we can see how temporary and easily subject to change the status of an enemy really is. If tomorrow we were to receive some unexpected assistance, praise or merely a kind word from this person, would we still regard him or her as our foe?"

If we feel justified in generating hatred towards our present enemy, then we should feel obliged to direct this hatred towards everyone, for sometime in the past we considered each person our enemy.

Then, by remembering their suffering and dissatisfaction, we will easily develop great compassion.

As a result of such a heavy non-virtuous action he was reborn in a hellish state of existence. In that karmically-created realm he had to endure the continual and excruciating suffering of having his head bored into. Around him were other beings who were all experiencing the same torment. The sight of these suffering beings stirred something within the boy's heart. Implanted on his mind was the karmic imprint of a previous beneficial intention, and when this arose in response to the others' torment he prayed, 'How wonderful it would be if all sentient beings were separated from all pains inflicted on their heads; may all such suffering ripen upon me!' Such was the power of this beneficial intention that all of the negative karma he had collected from harming his mother was completely purified. Immediately he was reborn in a god realm."

If, as stated, a Buddha has the ability to relieve all beings of their suffering, why have the countless Buddhas of the past not yet led everyone to enlightenment by now? The answer is as follows. Because Buddhas have overcome all obstructions and limitations they possess all the wisdom, compassion and skilful means necessary for leading others to Buddhahood. However, if sentient beings from their own side do not exert the necessary effort — if they do not bother to follow the path shown to them by the Buddhas — they will remain stuck within samsara. As has often been said, a Buddha cannot remove another's suffering and delusions the way we can pluck a thorn from another's flesh. Without a cooperative effort, nothing can be achieved. Merely relying upon an enlightened being is not enough."

[34] He quotes Buddha Shakyamuni as having said that one moment of anger directed towards a Bodhisattva — this peerless benefactor of all sentient beings — contaminates the mind with an enormous non-virtuous residue. As a result we will abide in the intensely suffering realm of the hell beings for as many aeons as there were moments of anger. [35] However, if we generate a virtuous mind, such as faith, towards a Bodhisattva, the fruits of this action will multiply even more abundantly than the results of an angry mind. While anger towards a Bodhisattva is thousands of times more non-virtuous than anger towards an ordinary being, faith in a Bodhisattva is far more meritorious than faith in an ordinary object."

In one of his previous lifetimes as a Bodhisattva, Buddha Shakyamuni appeared as King Maitribala. He was wise, charitable and well-loved by his subjects, and soon his fame spread far and wide. Eventually news of this king reached the abode of five cannibalistic demons. They became very jealous of his good qualities and as a result plotted to murder him. Knowing his reputation for generosity they appeared before him and begged for charity. The king immediately gave them much gold and silver, but instead of accepting this they replied, 'This is an inappropriate offering; we are cannibals so please give us your flesh and blood.' The king assented to this gruesome request and as he gave them some of his blood he prayed, 'As I am now satisfying them with my blood may I one day satisfy them with pure Dharma and thereby be of true benefit to them.' When this king was later reborn as Buddha Shakyamuni, these five demons were reborn as his first disciples. After listening to Buddha's first discourse, delivered in Sarnath and initiating the first turning of the Wheel of Dharma, these five became Arhats, attaining complete personal liberation from all suffering. [36] Thus even to those who do them harm Bodhisattvas return temporary and ultimate joy and benefit. Since these Bodhisattvas are the foundation for all sentient beings' happiness it is appropriate that we take continuous refuge in them."

Such a misguided way of practising Dharma will be completely empty of results."

I observed very carefully the law of actions and their effects, and relied solely upon the Three precious and sublime Jewels of refuge. For a long time I trained in the two methods for developing bodhichitta. Later I came to see that whatever appeared to my mind lacked true existence and was like an illusion.

This system of viewing the universe is quite different from the one presented by current scientific theory, and contains much that would be difficult to accept if interpreted too literally or concretely.

The colour of the sky over each continent is determined by the light reflected from Mount Meru. Because the southern side of Mount Meru is of the nature of lapis lazuli, the sky over the southern continent appears blue. In a similar fashion, the eastern side of Mount Meru is crystal and reflects a white light towards the eastern continent, the western side is the red of ruby and the northern side is the yellow of gold."

These gifts, representing all that is most precious and beautiful throughout the universe, together with the sun, the moon and other special items, can be assembled in an imaginative visualization and presented to Buddha, Dharma and Sangha in a form known as a 'mandala offering'. If such a visualized offering is performed seriously, its very vastness and supreme quality can have an extremely positive effect on our mind and thereby lead to the creation of great merit. A detailed explanation of mandala offerings can be found in the book The New Guide to Dakini Land."

The story is told of a small child who wished very much to be able to offer something precious to the Buddha of his day. Since he was poor and could afford nothing, he filled a bowl with dust and held it aloft, visualizing it as resplendent with gold. The strength and purity of his motivation were so powerful that he accumulated vast merit. He was later reborn as the great Buddhist king and benefactor Ashoka.

Such an attainment depends upon gaining successive realizations along the path and to gain these realizations we need a great wealth of merit, or positive energy. The disciples who lived at the time of Buddha Shakyamuni had great stores of such positive merit, and just by hearing one word of Buddha's teachings some of them quickly attained realizations. At the first turning of the Wheel of Dharma, for instance, when Buddha taught the four noble truths, several disciples gained a direct realization of emptiness, the highest reality, and some even attained the state of nirvana, complete personal liberation from all suffering. The Dharma taught these days is the same as that taught by Buddha Shakyamuni, and those who teach it are like Buddha himself, so why is it that even though we listen to teachings for months at a time we do not attain realizations? It is simply due to our lack of accumulated merit. Therefore, if we wish to gain realizations we must gather a great wealth of merit, and one of the main methods for doing this is to make offerings to the enlightened ones."

Milarepa wanted to test Padampa Sangye's spiritual powers and so he flew miraculously to the mountain near where the Indian was passing. As he awaited the arrival of the Pandit, Milarepa transformed himself into a flower near the roadside. When Padampa Sangye came by and walked past the flower, apparently unable to see through Milarepa's disguise, the Tibetan Yogi thought that the Indian had no powers of clairvoyance. Shortly after he thought this, however, the Pandit paused, turned around and walked back to the flower. Kicking it sharply he shouted, 'You, Milarepa, stand up!' Milarepa immediately resumed his human form and greeted the Pandit warmly, saying 'Welcome to Tibet. You are indeed a great Master.' To this Padampa Sangye replied, 'You too are very famous in India as a great Yogi.' The story of the competition they then held to demonstrate each other's miracle powers, and the songs of realization Milarepa sang afterwards, can be read in several biographies which have already been translated into English."

However, there is another sublime offering that we can make right at this present moment, and that is to practise the teachings we have received from our Spiritual Guide, or Guru. If our Spiritual Guide gives us instructions on how to abandon non-virtue and practise virtue and we follow these instructions faithfully, then this is a most sublime offering. Milarepa told his Teacher Marpa that he had no material objects to offer to him, but intended instead to repay his Guru's kindness by dedicating his body, speech and mind to the practice of Dharma. Because a Spiritual Guide is solely interested in the welfare of his or her disciples, such an offering of practice is much more pleasing to him than any amount of material wealth."

Detailed instructions on the techniques and benefits of these practices were taught by Buddha Shakyamuni, and commented on by later Pandits; and descriptions of the full-length prostration can be found in Stalks in Array Sutra (Skt. Gandhavyuhasutra). Offering prostration was a major practice of many great Indian Pandits.

According to one widely followed tradition, we begin by standing erect and placing the palms of our hands together in an attitude of prayer, the thumbs touching and tucked inside the palms to symbolize a wishfulfilling jewel. (It should be noted that merely to hold our hands in this or a similar gesture of respect, or even to bow our head slightly, qualifies as a physical prostration; it is not necessary to touch the ground at all.) We then touch our folded hands to four places on our body to plant the seeds to attain various qualities of an enlightened being. First we touch the top of our head in order to attain a Buddha's ushnisha, the crown protuberance that results from paying respect to our Spiritual Guide and which symbolizes a Buddha's inner realizations. We then touch our forehead, throat and heart in order to attain a Buddha's hair curl (a sign of wisdom), power of speech and power of mind respectively. If our motivation and faith are strong, these practices will place powerful potentials on our mindstream for our future attainment of a Buddha's transcendent body, speech and mind. After touching these four places we then bend down to do a half-length or full-length prostration and then immediately stand up again. We repeat this process at least three times and then always finish by touching our folded hands to our crown, forehead, throat and heart."

Even into old age he continued this practice. He was very tall and, because he could cover so much ground with his body, was able to accumulate much merit from his practice.

The generation of bodhichitta is of such great value that even the place where it is developed is worthy of veneration. In India there are many pilgrimage sites marking locations where famous meditators have gained spiritual realizations. Bodh Gaya in particular, where Buddha Shakyamuni demonstrated his attainment of full enlightenment, is considered a very auspicious place to make prostrations.

It signifies our determination to turn away from the endless cycle of confusion and dissatisfaction that has marked our life, and towards a saner, more wholesome way of living. As stated before, our past collection of negative actions of body, speech and mind has been responsible both for our day-to-day confusion and unhappiness and for our difficulty in gaining realizations along the spiritual path. If this uncontrolled pattern of behaviour continues unchecked, it will lead us to even more acute states of suffering and torment in the future. Thus there are two inter-related causes for our taking refuge in Buddha, Dharma and Sangha. First of all we must have a heart-felt dread of the miserable states of samsaric existence towards which our uncontrolled behaviour of body, speech and mind are propelling us. In terms of Buddhist cosmology this dread is interpreted as an intense aversion to the sufferings of the three lower realms of existence or, further, as a feeling of being disgusted with the unsatisfactory nature of all states conditioned by ignorance. In addition to this real dread we must have an unshakeable conviction and faith in the Three Jewels, understanding well how they have the power to protect us from all forms of suffering. Basing our conviction upon reason, proper authority and, most importantly, our own experience, we turn to the Three Jewels of refuge with the thought that only they can show us the path away from fear and dissatisfaction and towards peace of mind."

He fears that without proper training this unruly mind will expose him to the intense suffering of the three lower realms — those states of hellish, ghostly and brutish suffering that result from extremely non-virtuous actions of body, speech and mind.

At that very moment we enter the third path, the path of seeing, and all our intellectually-formed delusions are removed. We have become a Superior Bodhisattva: a noble Son or Daughter of the Buddhas. The remainder of our training involves the gradual elimination, on the fourth path, the path of meditation, of all the innate delusions and their imprints that still obscure our mind. When this is fully accomplished and there remains not even the subtlest veil covering the clear light nature of our consciousness, we achieve the fifth and final path, the Path of No More Learning, the full enlightenment of Buddhahood.

For instance, if we hold strongly to the notion that there is no effective refuge from worldly suffering, or if we develop faith in an improper object of refuge, such as our own delusions, or if we stubbornly deny that there is any causal relation between actions and their results, our mind will be misdirected and we will be preventing ourself from gaining a proper view of reality. As a result our ignorance will increase and lead us to create more and more harmful actions of body, speech and mind.

Some people think that the non-virtue of killing a small insect is insignificant when compared with that of killing a large animal. However, the mere size of the victim is not necessarily the most important criterion determining the gravity of our actions. The difference between great and small non-virtue is determined by the inter-relationship of four factors: object, time, action and mind. The heaviest non-virtuous karma will be incurred if the object of our non-virtuous action is venerable and worthy of respect. Such objects include, among others, beings of saintly character, a Buddha, a Bodhisattva, an Arhat, a member of the Sangha, a Spiritual Teacher or our parents. In terms of time, the heaviness of non-virtuous actions increases if they are committed on days set aside for religious and spiritual observance or the taking of vows. The way the non-virtuous action is performed also affects its heaviness. For example, killing another being by slow means, inflicting a great deal of suffering, is a heavier action than swiftly and painlessly taking another's life. Finally, the state of mind we are in when we perform a negative action greatly determines how heavy the results of that action will be. A mind that is strongly motivated by anger and rejoices in actions that harm others is an exceptionally evil mind and the non-virtue accumulated is consequently very great. The more these four types of negative characteristics are present within an action the more harmful will be the accumulated non-virtue."

There are three possible suffering effects of a particular non-virtuous action. The first, the fully-ripened effect of an action, is the future rebirth into which we are thrown by the ripening of the seed planted by that action. For example, if we kill someone and the four conditions of object, time, action and mind are sufficiently heavy, we can be reborn in a state of hellish suffering. The less heavy these conditions, the higher the realm into which we will be reborn. The second result of a non-virtuous action is known as the 'effect similar to the cause'. The specific torments of a life filled with much sickness and a child's possession of a cruel and sadistic temperament are examples of this second type of effect following from the non-virtuous action of murder. Finally, there is the environmental effect of our non-virtuous actions. The place where we must live our life, whether in one of the three lower realms or even when we gain a human rebirth again, will be inhospitable, barren and dangerous as a result of the non-virtuous tendencies killing places upon our mind.

Similarly, if we wish to raise ourself up after committing an unskilful action, we do so by relying upon the objects against whom we committed that action. In terms of the object, all non-virtue can be included within two categories: non-virtuous actions directed against the Three Jewels, and those directed against sentient beings. Purifying actions committed against the former, therefore, entails relying upon the refuge we take in Buddha, Dharma and Sangha.

In general there are six types of activity used as opponent forces to evil, but there is nothing magical about them. They are only effective when based on a strong foundation of regret and combined with a sincere desire to purify our negativities. These six traditional methods are: (1) reciting the names of Buddhas, (2) reciting mantras, (3) reciting Buddhist Dharma scriptures, (4) meditating on the profound view of reality (emptiness), (5) making offerings and (6) constructing, painting or repairing images of a Buddha's body, speech and mind."

Even sweeping a shrine room, if done with sincere regret and a strong intention to purify non-virtue, can be a very powerful opponent force. To illustrate this there is the famous story of the monk called Lam Chung, who lived at the time of Buddha Shakyamuni. Before he became a monk he had already gained the unenviable reputation of being dull and unteachable. He was sent to school but soon expelled because his teachers said he was unable to remember any of his lessons. Later his parents sent him to a Brahmin so that he might learn the Vedic scriptures. Again he was unable to remember or understand anything he was taught and was once again expelled."

Lam Chen took responsibility for his younger brother's education and began by teaching him one verse of Dharma. Lam Chung studied this verse for three months but never mastered it! If he memorized it in the morning he would forget it by the evening, and if he memorized it at night he would forget it by the following morning. He tried studying out of doors, hoping this would be helpful for his mind, but with no success. He recited the verse so often while up in the hills that even the shepherds minding their flocks came to memorize and understand it, but poor Lam Chung still could not master it. The shepherds themselves tried teaching him, but still Lam Chung was unable to learn it. As a result of his repeated failure, even his older brother Lam Chen was compelled to dismiss him."

The situation remained like this for a long time until, all of a sudden, Lam Chung was struck by the realization that the dust he was constantly sweeping lacked true, independent existence.

They decided that if they exposed Lam Chung's inadequacies in public they would not have to accept him as their leader. So they spread the word in a nearby town that a monk who was as wise as Buddha himself would be coming soon to give teachings, and that all those who attended would certainly attain great realizations.

Without hesitation he stretched out his hand so that it seemed like an enormous elephant's trunk and with it he reduced the throne until it was but a small speck. Then he returned the throne to its former size and, to the increasing amazement of the gathering, flew up to the top of it! After a brief period of meditation he flew into the sky and circled the gathering before returning to the throne. Seated once more he said: 'Listen carefully.

This is only one simple illustration, but we are all acquainted with similar situations from our own experience. What is the reason for such different results? In our example, both brothers have created the proper circumstantial causes for becoming rich, so why did they end up so differently? The reason is that the principal cause for success, in this case the practice of giving that leads to the attainment of wealth in the future, was created by only one of the brothers. If the other brother lacks this cause as an unripened seed upon his consciousness, he will never become rich no matter how hard he tries."

It was this action that planted in his mind the seed to experience suffering upon encountering the proper circumstantial cause. If he had not committed that non-virtuous action, and therefore had not created the proper substantial cause, then even if he ate food that gave others indigestion he would never experience this suffering himself. He would be like a peacock who is able to eat poisonous plants and, instead of becoming ill, grows stronger.

The causes for being born in one of these states as either a human or god include the practices of moral discipline, giving and stainless prayer. By engaging in selfless giving, keeping our moral discipline pure, practising patience, making the appropriate prayers and so forth, we can avoid the three lower realms and gain a higher rebirth. In addition, if we rejoice in others who are also following these pure practices, this will be the cause of even more benefit and merit for ourself."

Standing at the door was a beggar who rejoiced in the king's generosity but was saddened to think that he did not have the opportunity to perform such virtuous actions himself because he was poor. At the end of the banquet Buddha who understood the minds of all who were present, dedicated the merits of the beggar, and not those of the patron of the meal as was customary! The king, with great surprise, asked Buddha why he had done this. Buddha replied, 'On this occasion the beggar has practised purer virtue than you. The virtue of your offerings has been stained with worldly thoughts of reputation, pride and the like, whereas the virtue of the beggar's rejoicing was unmixed with such impurities. Thus I have dedicated his merits.'"

There are many paths that lead to the attainment of liberation but they are all included in the three higher trainings of moral discipline, concentration and wisdom. Ordinary moral discipline, abandonment of the ten non-virtuous actions, can lead to rebirth as a human or god, but is not adequate by itself for the attainment of liberation. For this, the moral discipline of renunciation for the whole of samsara is required. When moral discipline is conjoined with the thought of renunciation it earns the title 'higher moral discipline'. In a similar fashion, with renunciation as their base the practices of single-pointed concentration and insight into the true nature of reality become the trainings in higher concentration and higher wisdom. When these three higher trainings are completed the practitioner will definitely attain liberation."

By the time he has reached the eighth spiritual ground on the fourth path, the Superior Bodhisattva has abandoned all forms of delusion. However, the imprints of these delusions, the obstructions to omniscience, still remain, and these are removed by continual meditation on emptiness through the eighth, ninth and tenth spiritual grounds. Finally, even the last traces of the imprints of delusion are removed, and the Superior Bodhisattva attains the fifth path, the Path of No More Learning, the state of perfect and complete enlightenment.

Sadaprarudita himself attained the eighth of the ten Bodhisattva grounds, and suddenly flew up into the sky to see his Teacher. When he asked him why all these miracles had occurred, Dharmodgata replied that this was an auspicious indication of the great benefit received that day. Owing to Sadaprarudita's request and to Dharmodgata's own teaching, many thousands of beings had realized the correct view of emptiness and developed the precious mind of bodhichitta. This story illustrates the power of a high-level Bodhisattva to give his or her body to others without any difficulty. As Shantideva says:"

Many people nowadays are attracted to Tantra because they believe it will provide a shortcut to enlightenment, or at least endow them with magical powers, but these people have no understanding of how important the foundation of renunciation, bodhichitta and emptiness is for this higher path. Practising Tantra solely for the sake of benefiting this life, hoping to gain renown or special powers, does nothing but plant the seeds for hellish suffering in the future. Anyone who practises like this is like a misguided person who uses precious sandalwood to kindle a fire. Or, to cite other examples, such an ill-motivated practitioner is like a person who uses bank notes to light a cigarette, or a Rolls Royce to cart manure.

However, if a Bodhisattva is careless with his three doors of body, speech and mind, he will be unable to follow the practices correctly or keep his vows purely. Therefore, in order to prevent the precious bodhichitta from degenerating, Shantideva teaches the method of conscientiousness. Conscientiousness is a mental factor that is vigilant in preventing us from wandering towards delusions and being distracted by meaningless activities of body, speech and mind. Its opposite is a careless attitude of recklessness or unconcern leading to deluded activity, the creation of negative karma and the degeneration of our practice and precepts."

In terms of our speech, recklessness manifests as lying, divisive speech, hurtful speech and idle chatter.

The reckless person, on the other hand, speaks under the influence of delusion. His behaviour is impolite and what he says invariably upsets others and himself as well."

If we wish to practise Dharma well, we must develop conscientiousness. All Dharma communities have codes of discipline and ask the people living there to refrain from certain actions such as smoking, drinking, gambling and fighting. What is the reason for this discipline? It is not to punish the practitioners, though it might appear this way to some. Rather, these rules are laid down in order to help people practise conscientiously. Spiritual Guides continually remind us to abandon non-virtue and keep our mind from the influence of delusion. They do this so that our actions of body, speech and mind will be pure and we will be able to gain the fruits of spiritual practice."

'This young woman is obviously quite desperate and will certainly kill herself if I don't grant one of her outrageous requests. But which one should I choose? I definitely can't have sex with her; that would destroy my vows. As for killing the goat, that would be contrary to all that I believe.

As a result it is sometimes appropriate to abandon the task before it is completed. [3] This should not be the case with our bodhichitta wish and promise. Bodhichitta is only developed after we have deeply contemplated its benefits and made a thorough examination of all the reasons for cultivating this precious attitude. Having become convinced of the importance of developing bodhichitta, we make the solemn promise to benefit all sentient beings by attaining the full enlightenment of Buddhahood. To go back on such a deeply considered promise by being careless about our bodhichitta is therefore extremely unskilful."

Shariputra immediately cut it off and offered it to him with his left hand. The demon acted insulted and cried out, 'How dare you extend your left hand towards me! Have you no sense of politeness?' He continued to abuse the new Bodhisattva in this way for some time and then left. Shariputra was deeply saddened by this unreasonable behaviour and thought, 'If sentient beings are as unreasonable as this, how can I ever benefit them?' With that thought he abandoned his bodhichitta and returned to his former path of seeking liberation for himself alone. He eventually reached that goal and attained Arhatship in that very life."

It is beyond the power of limited minds to comprehend this fully. However, it is clear that while Shariputra did forsake his bodhichitta motivation he did not abandon his renunciation for samsara or his wisdom of emptiness. By meditating upon these two continuously he was able to reach nirvana and gain complete personal liberation from all suffering."

We should examine these four characteristics very carefully. Whoever possesses a high rank, a good reputation or wealth must eventually see it decrease, fall and ultimately vanish. Is there any real pleasure to be had from these attainments, and can any of them help us at the time of death? Can our husband or wife, our friends or family, our possessions or our government help us when it is time to die? To think that we will live in this world permanently is a gross self-deception. This world has no permanent residents. Of all the billions of people alive now, who will still be here in one hundred years? We are merely travellers passing through this world, and as travellers we must think to provide ourself well for our journey. Yet what do we need to take with us? None of the temporal pleasures mentioned above are of any value at the time of death; only Dharma practice — the training, controlling and purifying of our mind — can protect us from suffering."

After many difficulties he finally arrived at an island and, to his delight and amazement, discovered it was filled with gems of every description. But soon he became involved in the sensual pleasures of the island, took to drinking and gambling and completely wasted his time in meaningless activities. When he finally returned to his native country he had nothing to show for his troubles but the debts he had incurred. Was he not extremely foolish?

Just as it is very difficult to separate oil from the cloth it has stained, so it is difficult to separate the mind from the object of attachment with which it has become absorbed."

The I that we hold at such a time is unrelated to and independent of our body, our mind or the combination of them both. This mistaken way of looking at ourself is the chain that binds us to samsara.

Neither tigers, elephants, lions, bears, snakes, all other enemies, the guardians of hell, evil spirits nor even cannibals can frighten us. Why is this so? [5] Because all fear comes from the mind that is untamed. Thus a Bodhisattva who has trained his mind has no reason to fear any of the creatures just mentioned because he is always happy to surrender his body and possessions to others. For us, however, it is quite different. Because we have not controlled our self-cherishing mind, fear arises immediately whenever we encounter anything even slightly threatening. The only way to overcome such fear is to tame the mind."

One day from another land came a young man who had turned cannibal. Whenever people saw this bloodthirsty person draw near they fled in all directions; everyone except King Chandra. He remained where he was and even walked calmly towards the youth and introduced himself. The youth immediately lunged at him but King Chandra neither felt nor displayed even a trace of fear. To someone who had become accustomed by now to having people run away from him, the king's behaviour was surprising indeed! 'Aren't you afraid of death?' the young man cried in amazement. The king replied that he was prepared to sacrifice his body then and there if need be."

'Surely he must have a strong mind,' the young man thought and asked the reason for his lack of fear. King Chandra replied, 'Because I have trained myself in the practice of virtue I no longer have anything to be frightened of.' As soon as he heard these words the young man developed strong faith in the practice of virtue. He listened attentively as the king told of the suffering results that would certainly follow from his harmful and vicious actions. After receiving many teachings on the workings of actions and their effects, the youth felt deep regret for his past evils and promised from the depths of his heart never to commit any more. The subduing of the young man and the overcoming of danger were all accomplished because King Chandra had eradicated all fear by controlling his own mind. In the same way, if we secure the wild elephant of our mind to the proper object of virtue, our fears will likewise be overcome."

Not only by scriptural authority but also by logical reasoning can we understand that all our faults and problems depend upon our mind. Yet most of us do not stop to consider whether this is true or not; we automatically assume that both our suffering and our happiness arise only because of external causes and conditions. We believe that outer circumstances are the sole factors determining our state of mind. Some Indian schools of philosophy, for example, believe that everything is the creation of the gods Ishvara or Brahma. They believe all our experiences depend entirely upon them."

When we see our relatives and friends in a dream we believe at that time that they are really there, existing as something external to us. This, however, is not the case; what we have seen were dream images that merely arose from our own mind. Furthermore, when we watch the images on a motion picture screen we receive the impression that these pictures originate from somewhere in front of us when in fact they are being projected from behind us. Just as dream and motion picture images seem to have a certain 'external' existence in the ways described, when in fact they do not exist in their apparent manner at all, so the appearance of people and things in the universe seems to exist externally to us when in fact this appearance actually originates from our own mind. People without any Dharma understanding — those who have never done any in-depth analysis of the relation between appearance and reality — may perhaps laugh at such a view, but if we are ever to obtain an ultimate realization of the true nature of reality, the emptiness or lack of inherent existence of all phenomena, we must investigate this view thoroughly.

The reason is that giving is not perfected by eradicating all poverty, but by familiarizing ourself completely with the thought that is prepared to give up everything we have — our body, possessions, and the fruits of virtue — to other beings. The practice of giving does not merely entail bestowing gifts upon others, although this is definitely part of it. [10] Rather, giving is a mental training and involves acquainting ourself with the thought of giving without desiring anything in return. This perfection is not aimed at eradicating external poverty, though it undoubtedly helps alleviate want, but at eradicating our own internal miserliness. Therefore we can see that the true practice of giving depends entirely upon our mind."

Instead, moral discipline refers to a mind that abandons all non-virtuous actions. It is the maintenance and guarding of this mind that constitutes the true practice of moral discipline. Once the mind has become completely accustomed to abandoning every trace of non-virtue and transgression of vows, it has achieved the perfection of moral discipline.

If we kill someone who has harmed us, his relatives and friends will attack us in revenge.

We do this by preventing our attention from wandering to those visual objects that cause attachment, anger or other delusions to arise. Similarly our ear consciousness should be guarded from distracting sounds that foster delusions. The same is true for all the other consciousnesses; they should be kept in check and prevented from wandering towards what is non-virtuous. This is what is meant by guarding the mind."

We need not shut ourself off from all visual stimuli in order to overcome our delusions; if we gain control over our mind there are no external objects that can possibly harm us.

However, there are certain circumstances during which it is especially important to exercise control over our mind and guard it from delusion. [21] If, for example, we must associate with people who are so uncontrolled and irreligious that their only practice is non-virtue, we must guard ourself well or we will be tainted by their many faults. If we spend a lot of time in the company of those who deny the existence of actions and their effects, the continuity of consciousness, the possibility of liberation and so forth, we run the risk of falling under their influence. If our mind is well guarded, however, we will remain unaffected. Furthermore, those who have taken certain ordination vows must be careful when entering situations that could lead to a transgression of these vows. Monks and nuns, for example, should be particularly careful when associating with those they might find attractive; at such times they should post a strong guard at the door of their mind. Lay people as well should exercise caution whenever they find themselves in circumstances of great temptation or non-virtue. The best way to keep our good qualities and our vows from degenerating is to be diligent in guarding our mind. As Shantideva says:"

When the mind is placed upon the object single-pointedly, this is what is known as 'concentration'. As we practise concentration we should occasionally check to see if our meditation is progressing well or if interruptions and obstacles have arisen. This spy-like function of the mind is alertness.

[34] The basic practice is as follows: at the very beginning of any action, whether it is thought, word or physical deed, we should examine our motivation to see whether it is virtuous or non-virtuous. If we discover that the motive behind the action we are contemplating is defiled by one of the delusions such as jealousy, greed or ill will, we should bring to mind the faults of that delusion and immediately abandon it."

The Bodhisattva should realize that to tell an untruth to a would-be killer is not actually lying because his motivation is undefiled by delusions or the thought of self-cherishing.

Generally, however, our life is of such great value that it would be wrong to give it away for an unimportant reason. This precious human body is the vehicle in which we can travel along the Mahayana path to full enlightenment. To give it up for no great purpose would prevent us from proceeding along this path and being of benefit to others. Our death would indirectly harm all those whom we could have helped had we remained alive. Therefore it is generally much more important to preserve our own life, provided we are motivated by a compassionate impulse, than it is to comply too rigidly with a lesser moral injunction and allow ourself to be killed."

In a previous life Buddha Shakyamuni was a ship's captain and one day he was ferrying five hundred merchants across the sea. With his powers of clairvoyance he realized that one of the merchants was planning to kill all the others. He thought to himself, 'If he carries out his plan he will not only cause four hundred and ninety-nine people to lose their lives but will also create the cause for being reborn in the lower realms.' The captain realized that if he killed the would-be assassin he could prevent all five hundred people from being harmed. Therefore, with the motivation of great compassion he killed that merchant. As a result of this selfless action the captain purified much negative karma accumulated throughout many aeons and also collected limitless merit. This story illustrates the range of a Bodhisattva's actions, but most of us are not able to practise like this at the moment. We should be aware of our level of attainment and understand our limitations for, as the saying goes, if a jackal tries to jump where a tiger leaps he will only break his neck!"

The best way of achieving this balance is by decreasing or preventing our attachment and this can be accomplished in two ways. The first is to contemplate the body's impurity by analyzing each of its five parts: skin, flesh, bone, marrow and inner organs. The second is to meditate on the body's lack of inherent existence by seeing that nowhere among its parts is there an essential entity to be found. This second analysis, which will be explained more fully in the ninth chapter, will dissolve our concrete conception of what the body is and who we are, and thereby destroy the very foundations upon which attachment arises. By meditating on impurity and emptiness we can also reduce and eventually eliminate the attachment that arises towards someone else's body. A basic question we should always ask ourself is: 'Exactly what is it that I am attached to?'"

Unfortunately, the kind man was unaware of the type of fish he had saved; when it recovered it followed its natural instincts and ate all the other smaller fish in the pond. When the men who owned the pond came by they were very upset. When they saw the large intruder and understood what had happened, they killed it immediately. In the end, therefore, the fish that had been saved from dying was killed anyway, but not until it had killed many other fish as well."

The point is that if we wish to benefit others to the greatest possible extent we should first tame our mind, attain realizations and develop the wisdom that understands the consequences of our actions. This does not mean, however, that we should wait until we are well advanced before giving help to others. On the contrary, we should do as much as we can to help others, whether it is nursing the sick or saving an insect from drowning. We should merely realize that what we can do now is insignificant compared to the benefit we could bestow if we had a fully controlled mind. With this realization in mind, we should pray to be able to emulate the deeds of the exalted Bodhisattvas, and strive to attain such an advanced state ourself."

Teaching such a person will not benefit him or her and will only create downfalls, or obstacles, for ourself. The way to approach such a person is to satisfy his needs through material gifts and then, when his faith in ourself and in Dharma has been cultivated, introduce him to the pure teachings. Shantideva next gives a detailed account of the circumstances in which it is improper to teach Dharma. Because teaching should only be given to those who have the proper attitude we should never teach anyone whose dress, manner or bearing demonstrates disrespect. This would include those who cover their heads though they are not sick, those who have not put down their umbrellas, canes or weapons, and those who defiantly wear turbans. Of course, there are many things we must take into account when deciding whom to teach and whom not to teach. However, once we have taken stock of the situation and have developed rapport with a potential student, we should make sure that the teaching situation takes place in an atmosphere of respect and accords with Buddha's injunctions."

In such societies, therefore, it would bring great disrespect to Dharma for a male Teacher to give Dharma to an unaccompanied woman.

With his mind dwelling in patience, he would remain calm and untroubled, able to smile at his assailant and even treat him with respect. Such is the power of a well-controlled mind.

This recognition is necessary if we are to channel our efforts in the right direction. The second approach is to gain a deep understanding of why we become angry, and then work to counteract and eliminate the causes we have uncovered."

Yet self-grasping is a deeply entrenched habit of mind and it requires a great deal of time and effort to gain the profound realizations required to uproot it completely. However, there are other more immediate causes for the arising of anger and, since these can be dealt with right away, it is worth concentrating on them during the early stages of our practice."

[7] If we are prevented from fulfilling our wishes or forced to deal with a situation we do not like, in short, whenever we have to put up with something we would rather avoid, our uncontrolled mind immediately feels unhappy. This uncomfortable feeling eventually turns into anger and we become even more disturbed than before. For example, someone who wants very much to be with his lover will become extremely resentful of anyone or anything that prevents him from doing so. If she refuses to see him or leaves him for someone else, his unhappiness can easily turn into rage. Therefore, aside from innate self-grasping, frustration of our desires is the main reason for anger to arise."

However, if we refuse to deal realistically with the discomfort, cursing our illness or letting ourself become depressed, then not only might our physical pain increase but we will also experience the additional suffering of mental torment.

This recognition, which cannot dawn on a mind consumed with anger, is the basis for developing renunciation: the spontaneous and continuous wish to attain complete and utter freedom from every trace of dissatisfaction in life. Without firm renunciation there is no way to reach any of the higher goals along the spiritual path and thus no way to experience the boundless happiness of liberation and enlightenment.

On the other hand, the attainment of an attractive body and a pleasing appearance is the karmic result of the practice of patience."

The next type of laziness, being attracted to what is meaningless or non-virtuous, includes what most people think of as effort. It is a mind that is drawn to and distracted by worldly actions and meaningless activity, such as gambling, drinking, smoking and general worldly nonsense. The last type of laziness is that of discouragement. It refers to harbouring thoughts of our own inability or worthlessness with regard to Dharma practices. Because of such discouragement we lose all pleasure in our practice. Without abandoning these three types of laziness and developing the mind of effort, it is impossible to attain the supreme citadel of enlightenment."

Our motivation to indulge in them is often nothing more than a small-minded selfishness, and some of our accustomed activities are actually harmful to others.

Despite this intense suffering, no meaning or benefit was derived from those existences. The suffering was senseless and our lives were completely wasted. None of the pain we received brought us any closer to enlightenment and still we have not awakened. But the problems that arise in our pursuit of Dharma are very different. [22] If we can endure them and persevere with our practice, our experiences will have great meaning and value. Furthermore, these problems and sufferings are totally insignificant when compared to the torments of the three lower realms. The difficulties some Dharma practitioners encounter concerning food, clothing and shelter are nothing when we think of the suffering caused by the delusions.

In order to enter the Bodhisattva's way of life and benefit others we need to engage in those virtuous practices that Shantideva has been describing throughout the text. Actually engaging in these practices depends upon developing beforehand a powerful wish or motivation. This is what is meant by the power of aspiration. Once it has been developed, we should not waver in our practice or turn away from it but complete it with the power of steadfastness. The delight we take in generating effort along the path is due to the power of joy. If continuous practice tires our body or mind, we should relax from our efforts by employing the power of rejection (sometimes called the 'power of relaxation') and then continue once our strength has returned. 'Rejection', here, refers to the rejection or elimination of our tiredness through rest.

If we want to achieve results from a practice, then once we have started it we should complete it with self-confidence and thereby weaken the power of delusion.

An important way to ensure that our practices are balanced is to employ what is known as the 'power of rejection'. This has several applications. In general it means that when we are engaged in a virtuous practice we should occasionally take a break from it in order to overcome (that is, 'reject') our tiredness and then return to our practice when refreshed. It also means postponing our entrance into more advanced practices, such as giving away our body the way a Superior Bodhisattva can do, in favour of engaging in easier and more manageable practices, such as giving material aid to the needy. There is no benefit in pushing ourself into the higher practices before we are ready for them. For example, there are nine stages of progressive development through which we must pass when trying to cultivate a fully concentrated mind. It is impossible to meditate on the later stages and gain worthwhile results until we have practised the initial levels. Temporarily postponing higher practices until we are ready for them is a facet of the power of rejection."

In such a state whatever we do, whether it is reciting prayers, visualizing Deities or practising other virtues, will lack strength and be unable to produce significant results.

Similarly, for as long as our mind is blown about by distractions we cannot focus on our object of meditation clearly. If we could construct a protective screen of concentration around our mind, the focus of our meditation would become immovable and we would have an undisturbed view of any virtuous object we chose.

Because at present we only have one foot in Dharma; the other is firmly planted in the distractions of worldly life. Although we may have some small wish to practise Dharma and attain enlightenment we also hanker after the pleasures of samsara. Therefore there is no way for us to receive realizations quickly. Why are we so split between these two opposing desires? Because we lack the proper recollection and meditation on the fears of death. If we develop death awareness we will not waste our human potential on worldly affairs, but will instead be motivated to follow Dharma purely."

Because his original audience consisted of monks, Shantideva focused on a man's longing desire for a woman and presented as an antidote a description of the unclean nature of a woman's desire-provoking body. However, as Shantideva himself makes clear, this discussion should not be understood to imply that one sex is by nature unclean while the other is pure, or that sexual longing is only experienced by men.

As Atisha said in his Lamp for the Path (Skt. Bodhipathapradipa), if we do not gather all these necessary conditions it will be extremely difficult to develop tranquil abiding even if we sit in meditation for many years. When wishing to perform mundane actions, such as preparing a cup of tea, we cannot hope to be successful if we complete only one of the many necessary causes, such as having the hot water but no tea leaves. If this is true for ordinary activities, how much more necessary it is when seeking such an extraordinary state as tranquil abiding!"

The cushion should be raised a little at the back to allow us to assume the correct posture easily and hold it for a long time. As a further aid in making our seat more stable and firm, we can draw a swastika — the ancient Indian symbol of immovability and auspiciousness — and place it on the ground directly beneath the centre of the cushion. On top of this drawing we can lay two strands of couch grass symbolizing long life, and two of kusha grass symbolizing the clarity of wisdom, so that they are lying side by side with their tips pointing towards the front.

If we discover that our mind is full of wild, uncontrolled thoughts, we should try to eliminate them. We can overcome strong attachment, anger and all other types of mental disturbance by paying attention to our breath in the following manner. Breathe normally through the nostrils, without haste or noise, and mentally count 'one' on completion of the first cycle of the incoming and outgoing breaths. (If we like we can also visualize all our non-virtues, delusions and disturbances in the form of thick, black smoke that flows out of our mind with the out-breath and disappears in the far distance. When we breathe in we can visualize the blessings of all the Buddhas entering our nostrils in the form of pure, white light, which then dissolves into our entire body and fills us with inspiration. This visualization, however, is not essential and can be practised or omitted at our discretion.) This manner of breathing and counting can then be maintained for twenty-one cycles. If this is not sufficient to calm the mind, the process can be repeated until the noise of our mental disturbances has been reduced. Once our mind is free from such gross disturbances we can seek the actual object of tranquil abiding meditation, which can be a visualized Deity, a seed-letter, the thought of renunciation or love and so forth."

And if we have an object but our mind wanders elsewhere and everywhere, this is like a bird, who after landing on the ground, is unable to stand firmly in one place.

These methods should uplift the mind, but if they do not there is a more forceful technique that can be applied. We visualize the mind situated at the heart in the aspect of a small bundle of white light. Then we forcefully recite the syllable 'phat' (pronounced 'PAY') while visualizing this white light rising quickly up through our body and out of the crown of our head. The mind, in the form of this light, flies high up into space and becomes inseparable from it. This technique is very effective for energizing the mind and overcoming gross mental sinking."

At the time of this story he was meditating with seven thousand other Bodhisattvas in a forest called Samantabhadra. By his powers of clairvoyance he saw that if he went to the realm of the king Viradatta and taught Dharma, ten thousand people would attain liberation. But he also saw that if he did this King Viradatta would have him killed. He told his fellow Bodhisattvas that he would soon depart for that kingdom and teach the people there and that he would lose his life doing so. They implored him, 'Don't go and give up your life. Stay here. Think of the welfare of all sentient beings, not just those ten thousand.' However, Supushpachandra did not listen to their entreaties. He went to the kingdom, taught Dharma and led the beings there to liberation and enlightenment. As foreseen, the king became angry and jealous of his influence over his subjects and had him murdered. The Bodhisattva was so intent on dispelling the suffering of others that he willingly sacrificed his own life for their sake. He had fully understood the equality of self and others and thus was able to perform such an outstanding deed of compassion."

Understanding the disadvantages of self-cherishing is a powerful weapon to keep the self-grasping mind from arising. If we then concentrate on the advantages of cherishing others and actually develop the type of mind that cares about others the way we now care about ourself, no problems will arise to interfere with us. By receiving the complete set of teachings on how to meditate on equalizing self and others from a fully qualified Spiritual Guide, and then by striving to put these teachings into practice as much as possible, it is definitely possible to attain these bodhichitta realizations. All it requires is the proper motivation and continuous effort."

Similarly, through the power of familiarity we can hold this I in respect of the bodies of others as well. [116] If we acquaint ourself with cherishing others we can prevent pride, conceit and arrogance from arising no matter what we do on others' behalf. The Bodhisattva so closely identifies himself with others that his actions on their behalf never have an ulterior motive. When we feed our body we never expect anything back from it in return; we feel it is only natural and appropriate to take care of what we identify as our own. The Bodhisattva's actions with respect to others are done with a similar lack of expectation and with the same sense of appropriateness. As we train our mind in the Bodhisattva's way of life we should do everything for others that we would do for ourself. [117] Just as we protect ourself from even the slightest unpleasantness or loss of reputation, so too should we develop a compassionate and caring mind for others and strive to protect them as well from even the smallest suffering."

Whether the cause of fear is great or small, whether it is brought about by having to address a large crowd or because we are frightened of violence, this compassionate blessing was and still is effective. This is only one small example of how a high-minded Bodhisattva cherishes others and wishes to protect them."

By training ourself ceaselessly in the practice it is definitely possible to attain this elevated mind. Take the following example. There is a person whom for many years we regarded as our enemy. Now this year he becomes such a close friend that to be separated from him for even an hour brings us unhappiness. What caused such a startling change? It was entirely due to the power of familiarity. If we can learn to cherish an enemy we certainly can learn to exchange self with others."

These teachings, along with those on emptiness, are not appropriate for everyone. Those who lack Dharma experience can easily misunderstand the meaning and intent of these profound subjects. For this reason Shantideva referred to exchanging self with others as a 'holy secret'. Other great Teachers of the past felt the same way about this method of Mahayana mind training. Atisha kept these teachings very secret and only gave them to a few select disciples. Eventually, however, the Kadampa Geshe Chekhawa gave these instructions to many students, and wrote a famous text on mind training dealing primarily with this holy secret. A commentary to this text Training the Mind in Seven Points can be found in the book Universal Compassion."

As mentioned before, the source of all our suffering, without exception, is the self-cherishing mind. Furthermore, all of our happiness derives from one source, cherishing others. Take this precious human life for example. The great Indian Teacher Chandrakirti wrote in his Guide to the Middle Way (Skt. Madhyamakavatara) that the main cause of being reborn as a human or god is the practice of moral discipline. How did we practise moral discipline in a previous life so that we now possess the fruit of a fully-endowed human form? By cherishing the lives of others we abstained from killing. By cherishing others' possessions we abstained from stealing. By cherishing other people and their spouses we refrained from the various types of sexual misconduct. By cherishing others and not wishing to deceive them, cause disharmony among them, disturb their peace or waste their time we refrained from the four non-virtuous actions of speech: lying, divisive speech, hurtful speech and idle chatter. Also, because we cherished others we viewed ourself as low and held others as supreme, and thereby kept our mind free from covetousness and malice. Finally, because we cherished the instructions we received from others we took Dharma teachings to heart and abandoned wrong views."

Furthermore this human form of ours is endowed with certain additional attributes and these also are the result of cherishing others. Attractive features derive from the practice of patience, refraining from retaliating against others. Long life is the result of protecting others' lives and refraining from killing. People who are popular and well loved are reaping the fruit of loving and cherishing others in previous lives. Some people always seem to have good health and this is the result in particular of caring for the sick. Thus we can see that all happiness, without exception, arises from the attitude of cherishing others."

However, if for the sake of others we are harmed, then temporarily we will attain rebirth as a human or god, and ultimately we will achieve the supreme state of complete Buddhahood.

However, if we shift our concern away from ourself and begin to hold others in high esteem we will attain a fortunate rebirth, acquire respect and find ourself in pleasant company and surroundings. [128] Lastly, if we employ others with the selfish motive of gaining profit only for ourself we will eventually be reborn in a low social class and experience much servitude. However, if we employ ourself so that others may prosper we will gain rebirth with a good form and exalted status. [129] To summarize, whatever joy there is in this universe arises from cherishing and desiring the happiness of others, and whatever suffering there is arises from cherishing our own happiness.

Having established these categories, we feel haughty towards those in the first group, competitive towards those in the second, and jealous of those in the third.

If we contemplate these points deeply we will be motivated to destroy the demon of self-cherishing and win the state of Buddhahood for the benefit of all.

Using his powers of imagination and empathy [140] the practitioner exchanges places with those considered lower than, equal to or higher than himself, and from this new stance looks back at his former self, towards whom he then generates the appropriate feeling of jealousy, competitiveness or pride. All this is done without a trace of the crippling conception of undecided doubt, the mind that thinks 'It is impossible for me to do this.' With a strong determination and a conviction that this practice is indeed possible, the Bodhisattva engages in the exchange and cultivates thoughts of jealousy and so forth. There is no danger here of these attitudes giving rise to delusion because they are only directed at himself. In fact, by aiding the practitioner to identify strongly with others and cherish them as he would himself, these attitudes actually increase the power of his virtuous mind."

To make this exchange more evident Shantideva literally transposes the grammatical elements of the next several stanzas so that 'I' is now used to refer to someone else, while 'he' (or 'she') refers to the practitioner of the exchange: the would-be Bodhisattva, that is, ourself."

Buddha taught two Hinayana systems of tenets, Vaibhashika and Sautrantika, and two Mahayana systems, Chittamatra and Madhyamika. These systems present emptiness in different ways, but Buddha's final view is the view presented by the Prasangika school, which is a division of the Madhyamika school. According to this view, emptiness is the mere absence of inherent existence, and so a phenomenon's emptiness is its lack, or emptiness, of inherent existence. Inherent existence is the object of negation of emptiness. This means that in order to realize emptiness it is necessary to negate inherent existence. Through understanding that there is no inherent existence we come to understand emptiness. Thus to gain a correct realization of emptiness it is extremely important to recognize exactly what needs to be negated. We must gain a clear understanding of what inherent existence, the object of negation, means, for only then will we be able to refute it. Because we are so habituated to our ordinary way of perceiving the world it is extremely difficult for us to gain an understanding of the Prasangika view immediately. Our mind must be trained gradually so that we steadily approach the ultimately correct view. It is for this purpose that Buddha taught the four distinct systems of tenets."

One, which is valid, apprehends the conventionally existent mere I; and the other, which is invalid, apprehends the I as inherently existent. The latter is the mind of self-grasping. At present these two modes of existence of the self, one being true and the other false, appear mixed together and it is extremely difficult to tell them apart. At certain times, however, the falsely conceived self does appear more distinctly to us.

It is therefore very important to differentiate clearly between gross and subtle selflessness. In Buddhist literature we may find the object of negation of gross selflessness of persons and the object of negation of subtle selflessness of persons described in the same words, so great care is needed when interpreting the meaning. For example, when Khedrubje, one of the principal disciples of Je Tsongkhapa, explained the object of negation of the subtle selflessness of persons of the Chittamatra system he described the self-supporting, substantially existent person as 'the vividly appearing I that does not depend upon any part or collection of the aggregates'. Exactly the same phrase has also been used by scholars and meditators to describe the inherently existent person that is the object of negation of the subtle selflessness of persons of the Prasangika system. Even though the words used are the same, the meaning is quite different. Therefore it is important not to rely on mere words but to gain a true inner experience of the meaning based on scriptural authority, logical reasoning and skilful analysis. If I were to explain in detail the difference between a self-supporting, substantially existent person and an inherently existent person, it would take many pages. Those who wish to know clearly the difference between the two should consult Je Tsongkhapa's Essence of Good Explanations (Tib.

Since all the major schools agree that the person is empty of being self-supporting and substantially existent, they accept that the person is merely imputed in dependence upon his or her aggregates. However, the lower schools use the words 'merely imputed' in a different way to the Prasangikas. For the lower schools the words mean simply that a person appears to the mind due to the appearance of the person's aggregates. For instance, we say we see Peter when in fact we see Peter's body. In this case due to seeing Peter's body we say we see Peter. If we study and understand this well, we will realize that Peter is merely imputed in dependence upon his aggregates such as his body. Here 'merely' is used to exclude a person existing separate from the person's aggregates.

The adherents of the Chittamatra school see serious contradictions in the views of both the Vaibhashikas and Sautrantikas. When they search for the existent I within the five aggregates, they say the aggregates of form, feeling, discrimination and compositional factors are not the existent I. When they search within the aggregate of consciousness, they realize that the six consciousnesses — the five sense consciousnesses and mental consciousness — are not the existent I, and also the deluded mind is not the I. Finally they posit a consciousness-basis-of-all (Skt. alayavijana) and consider this to be the existent I.

According to them all the other schools have failed to make a correct identification. The Prasangikas show that no I can be found among the aggregates either individually or collectively. How, then, do they assert the I to exist? They accept the existent I to be the I that is merely imputed by conception in dependence upon any of the person's aggregates. Other than this, no I exists. It follows that the existence of an I is entirely dependent upon conceptual thought; there is nothing that exists inherently as an I. Nevertheless, the I that is imputed by conception is said to be existent provided that the basis upon which it is imputed is appropriate.

Through this meditation we can swiftly overcome dualistic appearance. Thus it is important to concentrate upon this meditation once we have gained an initial insight into emptiness."

Just as we grasp the rope as a snake, so we grasp a person as inherently existent. Both the snake and the inherently existent I are the conceived objects of their respective conceptual minds. The striped rope and our aggregates are similar in acting as the bases for such misconceptions. Grasping the snake, we become afraid; and likewise by grasping an inherently existent I we become subject to the fears of samsara. By realizing the non-existence of the snake we cease grasping at there being a snake; and likewise by realizing the non-existence of an inherently existent I we cease grasping at that as well. Having in this way caused our wrong awarenesses to cease we are released from the fears that they respectively produce."

Both of these wrong conceptual minds in turn give rise to fear. In order to eradicate these wrong conceptual minds it is necessary first to recognize their respective conceived objects — the snake and the inherently existent I — and then realize that they are utterly non-existent. Once we understand that the inherently existent I is non-existent, then by continually meditating upon its non-existence all grasping at an inherently existent I can be completely uprooted. Since such grasping is the root of all suffering in samsara, through abandoning it we also come to abandon all suffering."

Once we have recognized the inherently existent I, we have recognized the subtle object to be negated. It is then easy to realize emptiness. First we must recognize exactly what has to be negated; only then can its emptiness be determined. Initially we may have some difficulty in performing this investigation and see many contradictions in what is being taught. However, if we reflect seriously for a long time the mind will eventually become like clear space, free from all clouds of confusion."

Contact is the initial mental response to the meeting of a consciousness, a sense power and an object. This contact can be shown to lack true existence because its cause — the meeting of a consciousness, a sense power and an object — lacks true existence. [93] Firstly, if the meeting of a sense power (which possesses subtle form) with an object were a truly existent meeting, then would the meeting of the partless particles of the sense power with the partless particles of the object be truly existent? If this meeting is truly existent then it must be under one of two conditions: either with space separating the partless particles or with no space separating the two. In the former case, if there is space between them how can you maintain that they have met? In the latter case, if there is no space between them at all then it follows that the two particles must become completely one. This is necessarily so because, being partless, a meeting must be a total meeting of all aspects; a partial meeting — the top part of one particle meeting the bottom part of another, for example — would imply that one part of the particle is met with and another part is not. In which case the partless nature of the particle could no longer be maintained."

Without dissolving into each other there can be no mixing of the two partless particles and therefore no possibility of their meeting on all sides.

In this case consciousness would have to become form. The reason for this is as follows: if form were truly existent, its mode of existence would be inherent and unalterable. A meeting with it could not be a meeting with only one aspect of it because in this case its mode of existence would alter and become twofold: namely a mode of existence of being-met-with and another mode of existence of not-being-met-with. As this is clearly unacceptable, any meeting would have to be total. Such a total meeting would necessarily imply a oneness and thus a oneness of entity.

Prior to the arising of consciousness the causal condition of an object must first be established. Otherwise no causal relationship would be able to exist between a consciousness and its object.

If each of the parts were the car it would follow that there would be as many cars as there are parts. In this case, since none of the individual parts is the car, how can the collection of them all together be the car? The collection of the parts of the car is not the car because it is the basis of imputation for the car. The car is the phenomenon imputed in dependence upon the collection of these parts. As we previously saw in our example with Peter, the parts are first collected and then the name, in this case 'car', is given to this collection. The car is none of the parts nor the collection of its basis of imputation; it is merely a conceptual imputation existing in dependence upon a valid basis. In this way it lacks true existence.

Firstly we must receive instruction from a Samkhya Spiritual Guide in which the process of manifestation from the general principle is clearly explained. In this way we come to understand that all manifestations are produced from the general principle. Through meditation on this truth we proceed gradually to separate ourself from attachment to objects. Next, through depending upon a firm concentration we cultivate the clairvoyance of divine eye. When the divine eye is led to behold the general principle the latter becomes like an embarrassed mistress when seen by the wife, and as a consequence it gathers all of its manifestations back into itself. Thus all visual forms, sounds and so forth disappear and the permanent self remains alone and inactive, free from the experience of objects. For the Samkhya school this is liberation."

At the start of every action it is extremely important to generate a pure motivation, and at the completion of that action it is important to dedicate all the accumulated merit. Our initial motivation determines whether our practice is pure or not. For instance, if we practise Dharma solely for the sake of the pleasures of this life — to gain a good reputation and so forth — our practice will be impure. If our motivation is to gain rebirth as a human or god, this is a Dharma practice but its aspiration is of a person of initial scope. Higher than this is the motivation of practising so that we can release ourself from suffering and attain liberation; this is the aspiration of a person of intermediate scope. Finally, if we practise Dharma with the aspiration to attain the highest enlightenment for the sake of all sentient beings, this motivation is an aspiration of a person of great scope. Thus we can see that the scope of our practice depends mainly on our motivation for performing that action. That is why it is extremely important to generate a pure motivation before we begin any Dharma practice whatsoever."
