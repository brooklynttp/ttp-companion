From the rain of profound and extensive Dharma that he has bestowed upon his fortunate disciples, he has recently given comprehensive instruction on the great Bodhisattvacharyavatara (Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life). This commentary has now been made available in English with the title Meaningful to Behold, known in Tibetan as 'tong pa don den'.",

It explains clearly the mind of bodhichitta developed through equalizing and exchanging self with others \u2014 the foundation of the Bodhisattva's way of life. It also explains the benefits of this Mahayana mind, the way we should guard this mind, and how we should practise the great waves of the six perfections once bodhichitta has been cultivated. As a great gathering of the paths of the Mahayana tradition, it is therefore worthy to receive many flowers of praise bestowed with appreciation.",

When he returned home they asked him what was available, and he had to reply, 'I don't know; I have forgotten.' His journey to the shop was a complete waste of time. Similarly, if upon completion of this text we are unable to recall what is contained within each of its chapters, we should be ashamed of ourself. If our study of this text is to be worthwhile and not a complete waste of time, we should not only read the words but also try hard to learn their meaning.",
        "**Chapter One:** The ultimate goal of Buddhist spiritual practice is the attainment of the fully awakened state of mind \u2014 enlightenment, Buddhahood, or the highest nirvana. However, we will not be able to attain this fully awakened state if we do not first develop bodhichitta, the mind of enlightenment \u2014 the continual and spontaneous state of mind that constantly strives to attain perfect enlightenment solely for the benefit of all living beings. A businessman will put effort into a transaction if he understands there is profit to be gained. In the same way, if we see the many benefits of bodhichitta we will strive to develop it. For this reason the first chapter consists of a detailed explanation of these benefits.",
        "**Chapter Two:** If we are to develop bodhichitta we must destroy all obstacles hindering its growth. The main obstacle is evil \u2014 that which has the potential to produce suffering. The virtuous thought of enlightenment will not arise in a mind choked by the weeds of non-virtue. Therefore Chapter Two explains how to prepare the mind by uprooting all that is potentially harmful through the four opponent powers.",
        "**Chapter Three:** Purifying negativity is not sufficient by itself. We must also accumulate merit. It would be unsuitable for a beggar to receive a king in shabby surroundings; so too a mind bereft of merit cannot entertain the precious bodhichitta. Chapter Three explains how to acquire and hold on to bodhichitta.",
        "**Chapter Four:** Once we have taken hold of bodhichitta, we must prevent it from decreasing through conscientiousness \u2014 attending to the virtuous actions of body, speech and mind.",
        "**Chapter Five:** Having stabilized bodhichitta, we must bring it to fruition through taking the Bodhisattva vows and practising the six perfections. Shantideva discusses moral discipline in a chapter entitled 'Guarding the Mind with Alertness.'",
        "**Chapters Six to Ten:** Each remaining chapter is devoted to one perfection \u2014 patience, effort, concentration, wisdom \u2014 with the tenth chapter covering giving and dedication.",
        "The development of bodhichitta takes place in three stages, outlined in the prayer:",
        "*May the precious, supreme bodhichitta*\n*Grow where it has not yet grown;*\n*Where it has grown may it not decrease*\n*But flourish for evermore.*",
        "Chapters 1-3 explain giving birth to bodhichitta; Chapter 4 explains stabilizing it; Chapters 5-10 describe increasing it until full enlightenment. If we practise in accordance with these ten chapters, it will not be too difficult to attain enlightenment."

        "THE EXHORTATION TO GRASP THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS PRECIOUS HUMAN LIFE",
        "[4] Shantideva begins by reminding us that we now have a most rare and precious possession, a fully endowed human life. In contrast to the overwhelming majority of beings in the universe, including most of our fellow humans, we have the opportunity to do something truly meaningful with our lives. We are free of certain restrictions and in possession of certain abilities and beneficial circumstances that make it possible for us to attain goals far beyond the reach of most beings. But if we do not make use of our present existence in the most worthwhile manner possible, it will be extremely difficult to gain such a beneficially endowed human life again. To appreciate these points more fully we must acquaint ourself with the following detailed analysis.",
        "First of all, why is our present state of existence considered to be so rare and so difficult to attain? The reason is that we were not born human by chance. Every effect has a cause, and our present existence as human beings -- and as specially endowed human beings -- is the result of a number of specific and hard-to-create causes. In general, birth as a human depends upon having previously practised pure moral discipline and giving. Specifically, each aspect of a fully endowed human life (as described below) has its own appropriate cause. Furthermore, in order to have attained this life we must have generated pure thoughts, or prayers, to receive a bodily vehicle with which we would have the leisure and ability to improve our mind through the continued practice of Dharma, or spiritual teachings. To be effective, such prayers have to be unpolluted by attachment to temporal comforts and happiness. As it is rare that we create even one of these necessary causes, it follows that the fruit resulting from a combination of them all must be extremely rare to find.",
        "Our present situation can be understood in terms of the following analogy. If a person comes across a nugget of gold but does not recognize its rarity and worth, he may easily throw it away. At this moment we have attained a precious human life far more valuable than gold, but if we do not recognize its worth we are apt to squander it in meaningless and purposeless pursuits. Thus it is very important, first of all, to recognize the eight freedoms and ten endowments of this rare and precious opportunity.",
        "The eight freedoms, or leisures, are in reference to being free from eight states of bondage -- four encountered even when born as a human being. The four freedoms from the bondage of non-human states of existence are:",
        "(1)\tFreedom from being born as a hell being",
        "(2)\tFreedom from being born as a hungry spirit",
        "(3)\tFreedom from being born as an animal",
        "(4)\tFreedom from being born as an ordinary god",
        "The four freedoms from obstacles found within human existence are:",
        "(5)\tFreedom from being born and remaining in a country where there is no religion",
        "(6)\tFreedom from being born and remaining in a country where there is no Buddhadharma",
        "(7)\tFreedom from being born and remaining with mental or physical disabilities",
        "(8)\tFreedom from holding wrong views denying Dharma, such as disbelief in the karmic law of cause and effect, the continuity of consciousness, and so forth",
        "These eight states are called the 'eight freedoms' because they are free from obstacles that oppose or completely prevent our practice of Dharma.",
        "The ten endowments are of two types: the five personal and the five circumstantial endowments. The five personal endowments are:",
        "(1)\tBeing born human",
        "(2)\tBeing born and remaining in a country where Dharma is flourishing -- a so-called 'central land'",
        "(3)\tBeing born and remaining with complete powers, free from mental and physical disabilities",
        "(4)\tNot having committed any of the five actions of immediate retribution. These are killing one's mother, killing one's father, killing an Arhat, shedding the blood of a Buddha with harmful intention, and causing division within a spiritual community",
        "(5)\tHaving faith in the three sets of Buddha's teachings (Skt. tripitaka) and the Buddhist teachings as a whole",
        "The five circumstantial endowments are:",
        "(6)\tTaking human rebirth in a world where Buddha has appeared",
        "(7)\tTaking human rebirth in a world where Buddha has taught Dharma",
        "(8)\tTaking human rebirth in a world where pure Dharma is still being taught",
        "(9)\tTaking human rebirth in a world where there are people practising pure Dharma",
        "(10)\tTaking human rebirth in a world where there are benefactors and sponsors for Dharma practitioners",
        "These ten states are called 'endowments' because they complete the conditions conducive to the practice of Dharma.",
        "It is because of our accumulated virtuous actions that we have now attained this precious human life endowed with the eighteen above characteristics. Therefore, now is the time to rejoice at our extraordinary good fortune. What is the purpose of this precious human life and why is it so valuable to us? The purpose and value of such an existence lie in the opportunity it affords us to accomplish one of three outstanding aims. The greatest goal now available to us is the attainment of enlightenment, the complete and perfect awakening of a Buddha. The intermediate goal is the attainment of personal liberation from samsara, the vicious cycle of birth and death fraught with suffering and dissatisfaction; while the smallest goal is to win rebirth as a god or as a human being.",
        "In general we remain completely unaware of the value of our present situation. In particular we are blind to the precious opportunity we now have to attain one of these three goals. Instead we waste our time and squander this precious opportunity by running after the temporary pleasures of this life. If we were to recognize fully the value and potential of this precious human life we would certainly take advantage of it by studying Dharma and seeking one of the three goals. As Shantideva says, 'If no meaning is derived from this precious rebirth now, how can we ever hope to come across it again in the future?'",
        "There is a story that illustrates the importance of taking full advantage of our precious human life. In a remote village in Tibet there lived a man who had no legs. One day as he was making his slow, laboured way across the countryside with the aid of crutches he accidentally fell over the edge of a cliff. As luck would have it he landed on the back of a wild horse grazing below. The horse was so startled that it galloped off with the man holding on for dear life. Quite a long time passed and, to the wonderment of the other villagers, the man showed no signs of tiring of his unusual mount. 'Why don't you get off that horse?' they shouted to him as he raced by. 'Not on your life!' he shouted back to them. 'This is the first time in my life I've ever been on horseback. When can a legless man like me ever hope for such an opportunity again? I'm going to take full advantage of it while I can.' And off he went, clutching on to the back of the wild horse. Just as the man in this story took advantage of his unusual luck, so should we take full advantage of our present fully endowed human life by training our mind in the practice of Dharma.",

        "4\tPraise to the one who gives birth to bodhichitta",
        "AN EXPLANATION OF THE BENEFITS OF BODHICHITTA",
        "As indicated before, the supreme method for making this rare and precious human rebirth meaningful is to use it as a vehicle for attaining the most perfect and complete enlightenment. To work for any lesser goal is to throw away this unique opportunity. Since the attainment of enlightenment depends upon first developing the mind of enlightenment, bodhichitta -- the motivation to achieve full enlightenment in order to be most effective in helping others out of their suffering -- Shantideva encourages us to develop bodhichitta, and describes its many advantages. These are divided into the following ten outstanding benefits.",
        "The conquest of all great evils",
        "[5] Just as a sudden, powerful flash of lightning on a pitch-dark night briefly illuminates the landscape, so the powerful blessings of Buddha cause worldly people to develop, at least for a short time, the intention to practise virtue.",
        "[6] Usually the virtues of worldly people are weak, while their instincts for non-virtue are strong. Thus we must constantly strive to overcome the great power this evil of non-virtue exerts upon us, replacing it with a strong practice of virtuous actions. Otherwise, if we do nothing to correct our present situation, the sufferings of samsara will be our sole experience. What is the best method for abandoning evil and creating virtue? We must strive to attain the precious bodhichitta. Only it has the power to overcome evil and abundantly increase our virtue. Other than the boundless mind of bodhichitta what else has the ability to subdue such great evil? By reflecting upon this well it becomes clear that we must definitely develop bodhichitta.",
        "The attainment of the most sublime happiness",
        "[7] In general there are many ways in which we can benefit sentient beings, but the Buddhas who have spent aeons examining the best way to help others say that developing bodhichitta is the supreme method. Why is this? Because with the development of bodhichitta we are not only able to attain the supreme happiness of Buddhahood for ourself, but we are also able to lead countless masses of sentient beings to the incomparable bliss of this supreme state. Recognizing the matchless benefits bodhichitta has for ourself and others, we should strive to attain it.",
        "Wish-fulfilment",
        "[8] A further benefit of developing bodhichitta is that all of our wishes will be fulfilled. If we want to be released from the many miseries of samsara and dispel the unhappiness of others, bodhichitta can fulfil these aims. In addition it fulfils the desire of all beings, including ourself, who long to experience limitless and immeasurable joy. Therefore, since this mind of enlightenment grants all wishes, Shantideva advises us to reflect upon its many benefits and never cease striving to attain it.",
        "Bodhichitta carries with it a special name and meaning",
        "[9] Shantideva says that anyone who develops bodhichitta is thereafter referred to as a 'Son of the Buddhas' (literally, a Son of the Sugatas), a Bodhisattva. Such a person becomes an object worthy to be venerated and respected by worldly gods, such as Brahma and Indra, and all of humanity, including high-born kings and queens. It does not matter if the person developing bodhichitta is a poor, shabbily dressed beggar. Upon his generating the mind of enlightenment he, too, would become an object worthy of the highest veneration.",
        "It is important to remember that we do not need to be a monk or of aristocratic birth or to possess a male body in order to develop bodhichitta. Although Shantideva uses the title 'Son of the Buddhas', he is not using it restrictively. When a woman develops the mind of enlightenment she becomes known as a 'Daughter or Princess of the Buddhas' and likewise becomes an object to be venerated by all gods and humans.",
        "Why does developing bodhichitta entitle us to so much respect? Because all Buddhas -- those fully awakened beings from whom supreme happiness derives -- are born from Bodhisattvas, who are so-called by virtue of their bodhichitta motivation, their intention to win full awakening for the benefit of all. Thus Buddhas arise from Bodhisattvas who in turn arise from bodhichitta.",
        "To stress the supreme value of bodhichitta, Buddha Shakyamuni says that it is even more important to prostrate, or pay homage, to a Bodhisattva -- someone who has developed bodhichitta -- than it is to prostrate to a Buddha. He explains this by using the example of the waxing moon. If someone bows down to the new moon it is the same as bowing down to every phase of the moon between new and full. Why? Because by paying respect to a cause we are implicitly paying respect to each of its succeeding effects. Thus, if we prostrate to a Bodhisattva we are implicitly paying homage to all the future states of his or her development, up to and including the attainment of Buddhahood. For such reasons then, bodhichitta is very precious and anyone who develops this mind becomes worthy of veneration.",
        "The great Indian Pandit Atisha had many Teachers and received much instruction from them concerning the development of bodhichitta. But not being satisfied he set out on a dangerous journey to present-day Indonesia in order to receive teachings from the famous Guru Serlingpa (Suvarnadipa). The difficult voyage took thirteen months, but from this Guru Atisha was able to receive flawless and complete instructions on the method for developing the mind of enlightenment.",
        "Although Atisha had over one hundred and fifty Teachers, he referred to Serlingpa as his root Guru. Even many years later when he was in Tibet, if Atisha even heard the name of his root Guru he would immediately descend from his seat and prostrate to him. The Tibetans noticed that he did not do this for any of his other Teachers and asked him why. He replied that from the instructions given him by Guru Serlingpa he realized how to develop the precious bodhichitta. Atisha, the possessor of great learning, held bodhichitta supreme; consequently he venerated Serlingpa above all his other Teachers.",
        "Transformation of the inferior into the supreme",
        "[10] Alchemists assert that there is a special elixir that has the power to transform base metals into gold. If we develop and practise bodhichitta, this impure human body of ours will likewise be transformed into the priceless, peerless jewel of a Buddha's holy body.",
        "The way to meditate on this point is as follows. First we should continually contemplate the impurity of the human body, thinking how undesirable it is to take rebirth constantly in such a gross and impure form. We should abandon whatever desire we might have for this ordinary human body and think instead of the preciousness of the transcendent body of a Buddha. We must develop the strong wish to attain this holy form and consider by what causes we may receive it. Upon continued reflection we will come to recognize that such a form can be achieved solely through the power of bodhichitta. Understanding this, we should then develop a strong determination to attain bodhichitta and mindfully hold this determination.",
        "The value of the precious bodhichitta, so difficult to find",
        "[11] Amongst all jewels the fabled wishfulfilling jewel is the rarest, most priceless, and of foremost importance because it alleviates the poverty of all. Similarly, amongst all kinds of virtue the rarest and most priceless is bodhichitta because it alone can dispel the poverty of those who are poor in virtue. Those who wish to be freed from the sufferings of samsara should firmly maintain this precious bodhichitta.",
        "A skilful oarsman ferries merchants from the mainland to a jewel island. Similarly, Buddha is an oarsman possessing a mind of boundless compassion and skilful methods. This mind is the boat of bodhichitta and in it he ferries all sentient beings across the ocean of suffering to the jewel island of enlightenment. If we make a thorough examination we will clearly see that this boat of bodhichitta is the most sublime and rarest of all methods to achieve happiness.",
        "The inexhaustible and increasing fruits of bodhichitta",
        "[12] Virtues other than bodhichitta are like the banana or plantain tree, the fruits of which are limited and soon exhausted. For instance, a person becomes rich because of his practice of giving in a previous life, but the fruits of such virtue are gradually used up, and when these riches are finished no more will come.",
        "In contrast, the virtuous fruits from the celestial tree of bodhichitta are inexhaustible. They are like a drop of water that falls into a vast ocean and is therefore never lost until that great ocean itself becomes no more. Even though our virtues in general may be weak, when motivated by bodhichitta their fruits will never be exhausted until we attain complete awakening. Why are the fruits of such actions limitless? There are two reasons for this. First, since the number of sentient beings benefited by a Bodhisattva is countless, the merit arising from actions created for their sake will likewise be limitless. Secondly, since all such merit is dedicated solely for our attainment of enlightenment it will not be exhausted until this enlightenment is reached.",
        "It is said that giving even a little food to a single beggar, if done with the motivation of bodhichitta, produces inexhaustible merit. If we lack such a motivation it does not matter how much gold or silver we give to no matter how many people; the fruits of such virtuous actions are limited and will soon be exhausted. When we realize how abundant are the fruits of all actions proceeding from bodhichitta, we will see that there is nothing more important than striving to attain this precious mind.",

Secondly, since all such merit is dedicated solely for our attainment of enlightenment it will not be exhausted until this enlightenment is reached.",
        "It is said that giving even a little food to a single beggar, if done with the motivation of bodhichitta, produces inexhaustible merit. If we lack such a motivation it does not matter how much gold or silver we give to no matter how many people; the fruits of such virtuous actions are limited and will soon be exhausted. When we realize how abundant are the fruits of all actions proceeding from bodhichitta, we will see that there is nothing more important than striving to attain this precious mind.",
        "The power of protection from great fear",
        "[13] A man travelling in an area where there is great danger from robbers and wild animals will be filled with great fear. However, if he entrusts himself to the protection of a courageous guide he will immediately be relieved of his anxieties. We human beings, because we have committed very harmful and evil actions in the past, are likewise exposed to the fearful dangers of birth in one of the three lower states of existence -- as a hell being, hungry spirit or animal. Even as a human being we fear birth, sickness, loss, violence, old age, death, and the other painful effects of our non-virtuous actions. What has the power to relieve us of this fear? Only the precious bodhichitta. Therefore why do those who are vigilant and wise not devote themselves to the development of this precious mind?",
        "The swift and easy destruction of great evil",
        "[14ab] The world in which we live undergoes great cycles of birth and decay. At the end of the present great aeon our universe will be completely destroyed by fire so that not even the ashes of it will remain. This all-consuming fire will be completely different from the ordinary fires of this world and thousands of times more intense. If we give birth to the precious bodhichitta, the fire of that mind will be similarly intense, sufficient to consume instantly all the immeasurable evil we have accumulated.",
        "Scriptural citations of the benefits of bodhichitta",
        "[14cd] The extensive benefits of bodhichitta were explained to the Bodhisattva Sudhana by Buddha Maitreya in Stalks in Array Sutra (Skt. Gandavyuhasutra). In the conclusion to this fourteenth verse, Shantideva advises those who wish to learn about these many advantages to consult that famous Mahayana scripture.",
        "If we are to engage in the actual development of bodhichitta we need strong inspiration, and this is only acquired by reflecting on the many benefits of this mind. If we knew of a king who had great wealth, power and knowledge we might easily think, 'How wonderful it would be to become like him!' Such a desire arises only because we have seen the good qualities that king possesses and therefore we wish to emulate him. Similarly, first we must understand the good qualities of bodhichitta and only then will the thought arise, 'How wonderful it would be to give birth to such a precious mind!'",
        "At present, however, if someone were to ask us which we would prefer, to develop bodhichitta or possess a nugget of gold, we would certainly choose the gold. This is because we see the valuable qualities of gold but fail to see the incomparable qualities and benefits of bodhichitta. If we understood these benefits our choice would be different. We would realize that while gold is easily obtained, no amount of money in the world can buy bodhichitta, something not found for sale anywhere. The only way to obtain the precious bodhichitta is to develop it ourself through long meditation.",
        "Until we develop a continuous and spontaneous aspiration to develop bodhichitta we should spend much time contemplating its benefits in general. From Shantideva's list of ten benefits we should select the one that has the strongest positive influence on our mind and meditate reflectively upon it. For such a meditation to be of greatest value it should be continuous and concentrated. Then at the close of the meditation session we should repeat the prayer originally cited in the introduction to this commentary:",
        "May the precious, supreme bodhichitta",
        "Grow where it has not yet grown;",
        "Where it has grown may it not decrease",
        "But flourish for evermore.",
        "By reciting this prayer we are stating our desire to give birth to bodhichitta as quickly as possible. We can recite this prayer after performing any virtuous action.",
        "We should remember that, without bodhichitta, whatever powers we may have and whatever miracles we may be able to perform are of no real benefit. Being able to fly in the sky is of no importance for even birds are able to do this. We have had such miracle powers and clairvoyance many times in our previous lives, but what have they done for us? Now is the time to control our untamed mind with bodhichitta. With bodhichitta the mind is made peaceful; enlightenment and the fulfilment of all our wishes are not very far away.",
        "It is important to remember that we cannot attain enlightenment if we do not first acquaint ourself with and then master the methods for developing bodhichitta. We must practise these methods as diligently as possible, all the while exhorting ourself to generate this precious attitude. Nowadays, with the world in turmoil, there is a particular need for us to cultivate bodhichitta. If we are to make it through these perilous times, true Bodhisattvas must appear everywhere, throughout the world.",
        "To develop bodhichitta we must complete four preparations. It is very important to know these because if we prepare well it is easy to develop bodhichitta. Thus we should (1) acquaint our mind with the benefits of bodhichitta, (2) accumulate a wealth of merit, (3) purify ourself of all non-virtue and (4) understand the method for developing bodhichitta. The last point will be discussed in the next section of this commentary."

        "RECOGNIZING BODHICHITTA",
        "This has three parts:",
        "1\tThe divisions of bodhichitta",
        "2\tThe benefits of the aspiring mind of bodhichitta",
        "3\tThe benefits of the engaging mind of bodhichitta",
        "THE DIVISIONS OF BODHICHITTA",
        "If our meditation on bodhichitta is to be successful we need to understand exactly what the essence of this mind is. As already stated, bodhichitta is a spontaneous and continuous state of mind that seeks enlightenment solely for the benefit of all sentient beings. Shantideva says [15] that this mind is of two types: aspiring bodhichitta and engaging bodhichitta. To understand the significance of and the distinctions between these two types of mind it is helpful to be familiar with the traditional methods of cultivating bodhichitta.",
        "Bodhichitta can be developed by following either of two methods: (1) the sevenfold cause and effect instructions, or (2) equalizing and exchanging self with others. The first method was originally taught by Buddha Shakyamuni and subsequently passed through Maitreya and Asanga in an unbroken lineage to such masters as Serlingpa and Atisha. The second method -- equalizing and exchanging self with others -- was designed specifically for those of sharp intelligence. It was also taught by Buddha Shakyamuni and passed through Manjushri in an unbroken lineage of Indian Masters to Shantideva himself. Both lineages have survived to the present day and are currently held by accomplished Teachers of all traditions of Mahayana Buddhism.",
        "Equalizing and exchanging self with others will be explained at length in the eighth chapter. What follows is an explanation of developing bodhichitta by means of meditating on the sevenfold cause and effect instructions. This method flourished widely throughout India and Tibet, and by studying it we will see that bodhichitta is not something that can be attained instantly, but rather is the result of a gradual training and development of the mind.",
        "The sevenfold cause and effect is a method involving the successive development of seven realizations, as follows:",
        "(1)\tRecognizing that all living beings are our mothers",
        "(2)\tRemembering the kindness of all mother beings",
        "(3)\tDeveloping the wish to repay the kindness of all mother beings",
        "(4)\tDeveloping affectionate love",
        "(5)\tDeveloping great compassion",
        "(6)\tDeveloping superior intention",
        "(7)\tDeveloping bodhichitta",
        "This method is called the 'sevenfold cause and effect' because these seven realizations are a chain of cause and effect leading to the final realization of bodhichitta. For example, the realization of affectionate love acts as a cause for developing great compassion.",
        "Before we begin our meditation on the sevenfold cause and effect it is helpful first of all to meditate on equanimity. At present our mind is unsettled and biased; instead of looking at all beings equally with the eye of compassion, we feel very close towards some and very distant from, or even hostile towards, others. In such an unbalanced state it is very difficult to recognize all beings as our mothers -- the first of the seven cause and effect realizations. Therefore, if our meditation is to be successful we must first try to remove our prejudices by cultivating an attitude of equanimity.",
        "Briefly outlined, the way to develop equanimity is as follows. First we should bring to mind three people we presently regard as our enemy, our friend and a stranger. Then we should ask ourself why we have categorized them in this way. Upon inspection we will find that the person we now call our enemy has received this label because of some harm -- great or small, mental or physical, real or imagined -- he or she has given us in the past. If we think back, however, we can often remember occasions when this same person treated us with much kindness. And if we could see into our past lives (as will be discussed later) we would undoubtedly discover instances in which this so-called enemy was our selflessly kind mother, feeding us with her own milk and protecting us from harm and fear. Even without considering any lifetime but the present, we can see how temporary and easily subject to change the status of an enemy really is. If tomorrow we were to receive some unexpected assistance, praise or merely a kind word from this person, would we still regard him or her as our foe?",
        "The same considerations can then be applied to the person we now call our dear friend. Although the sight, or even the mere thought, of him or her now elicits a warm feeling in our heart, this was not always the case. There were times, either earlier in this lifetime or in previous lives, when this dear friend or relative was our chief enemy and, as such, inflicted great suffering upon us. And it can easily happen that because of some slight difference of opinion, hasty word, or thoughtless act we suddenly find ourselves estranged from the same person to whom we are now so attached.",
        "In a similar fashion, the stranger has not always been the object of our indifference, nor will he or she always remain so. There have been times when this person -- so invisible to us now that we may scarcely be aware of his existence -- has been our murderous enemy, and other times when he has been our dearest friend and protector.",
        "By using examples from our own and others' experiences and employing various lines of logical reasoning, we can become convinced that it is extremely short-sighted and ultimately very mistaken to think that anyone is permanently or inherently a friend, enemy or stranger to us. And if this is the case -- if these three positions are so temporary and variable -- then who is the proper object of our attachment or hatred? If we feel justified in generating hatred towards our present enemy, then we should feel obliged to direct this hatred towards everyone, for sometime in the past we considered each person our enemy. And if it is correct to feel attached and biased towards our present friend because of some benefit we have received from him or her recently, then we should feel similarly towards everyone, because at one time or another everyone has been extremely kind to us, even to the point of being our mother.",
        "If we exert enough energy in meditation, acquainting ourself with the above reasons and examples and try to view people in an altered status, we will come to see how narrow-minded it is to be very close to some beings while remaining hostile or indifferent to others. Instead of assenting, as we do now, to a hard and fast classification of friend, enemy and stranger, and therefore being biased in our outlook, we can develop true equanimity -- the basis of the love and compassion necessary if we are to generate the precious bodhichitta and achieve enlightenment. As this is such an extremely worthwhile goal, we should not let our current prejudices go unexamined but expose them in the manner described.",
        "At this point a doubt may arise with respect to the meditation just described. It has been stated that the purpose of developing equanimity is to prepare us to recognize all beings as our mother. We may therefore wonder, 'If it is correct for me to regard all beings as my mother because they have supposedly been my mother in the past, then isn't it likewise correct for me to regard everyone as my enemy for the same reason?' To recognize the fallacy of this conclusion we must understand that whenever we have called anyone our enemy we have done so for basically unsound reasons and as the result of a mistaken view on our part. The habit of blaming our troubles and suffering on others -- on the so-called enemy -- is a deluded way of thinking, one that fails to realize that it is our own state of mind and not any external circumstance that is ultimately responsible for whatever misery we experience.",
        "At the root of our decision to regard someone as our enemy is a false projection of our mind, a mistaken conception of events. Forgetting such things as the kindness and parental nurturing this person has given us, and unaware of our own culpability for our suffering, we take the harm we receive from another as a valid justification for calling him or her our enemy and treating him with hostility. Although this is something we do all the time, it is in fact completely deluded and ultimately indefensible. On the other hand, as will be explained in the following section, there is nothing false or deluded about regarding all beings as our mother. This is true and verifiable, and not only opens the gateway for continued spiritual growth but provides us with an immediate experience of happiness and well-being.",
        "The goal of equanimity meditation is to remove all biased attitudes of mind and thereby to view all beings without discrimination as our mother. This in turn will motivate us to consider how we can repay their infinite kindness. If, as a result of this meditation, we are able to regard even our most hated enemy as our kind mother, we are ready to gain a realization of the first stage of the seven causes and effects leading to the development of bodhichitta."

        "THE BENEFITS OF THE ASPIRING MIND OF BODHICHITTA",
        "It has been said that if we were to offer a universe full of jewels to the fully enlightened beings the merit created would be great indeed. However, Buddha Shakyamuni has said that the merit that arises merely from the mind that seeks enlightenment for the benefit of others is thousands of times greater than this. Such an aspiring mind overcomes the disadvantages and hindrances of samsara, and outshines the qualities of those spiritual practitioners -- the so-called Hearers and Solitary Conquerors -- who work only for their own liberation. [17] As great as these benefits are, however, an uninterrupted flow of merit does not arise from the aspiring mind in the way that it does from the engaging mind.",
        "THE BENEFITS OF THE ENGAGING MIND OF BODHICHITTA",
        "[18-19] From the time when the complete Bodhisattva vows are taken with the fearless mind that never turns back from its task of freeing all sentient beings from their suffering and leading them to enlightenment, great and unimaginable merit arises. The merit of such a mind is much greater than that which arises from the aspiring mind, and it comes even when the Bodhisattva is asleep, unconcerned or apparently intoxicated. Moreover, whatever actions of body, speech and mind the person possessing this engaging mind undertakes become the cause for his or her eventual attainment of the highest and most perfect enlightenment.",
        "THE REASONS FOR THE BENEFITS OF BODHICHITTA",
        "There are two types of reasoning that establish the immense benefits of bodhichitta: reasoning from scripture and from logic. As for the former, [20] in Sutra Requested by Subahu (Skt. Subahupariprcchasutra) Buddha himself listed the many benefits of developing bodhichitta. Why was this teaching given? In order to persuade those who were inclined to the Hinayana path, which leads only to our own liberation from suffering, to follow the Mahayana path, which leads to full enlightenment for the sake of others.",
        "The reasoning from logic establishing the benefits of bodhichitta follows from the observation that in general there are many types of virtuous or beneficial intentions we might have. For instance, a mother has a beneficial intention towards her child, and we may have a beneficial intention towards the poor and needy. But the beneficial intention of a Bodhisattva, whose great compassion extends to all living beings, is much greater than either of these examples. The difference between an ordinary being's virtuous impulse and that of a Bodhisattva is like the difference between the width of a fingernail and the vast expanse of the sky.",
        "The extensive and unsurpassable benefits of bodhichitta are illustrated by the following story taken from a previous life of Buddha Shakyamuni. It is related that in that particular lifetime he created much negative karma by fighting with his mother and stepping over her head as she lay on the floor trying to block his departure. As a result of such a heavy non-virtuous action he was reborn in a hellish state of existence. In that karmically-created realm he had to endure the continual and excruciating suffering of having his head bored into. Around him were other beings who were all experiencing the same torment. The sight of these suffering beings stirred something within the boy's heart. Implanted on his mind was the karmic imprint of a previous beneficial intention, and when this arose in response to the others' torment he prayed, 'How wonderful it would be if all sentient beings were separated from all pains inflicted on their heads; may all such suffering ripen upon me!' Such was the power of this beneficial intention that all of the negative karma he had collected from harming his mother was completely purified. Immediately he was reborn in a god realm.",
        "[21] Shantideva uses the example of the great merit that arises from a beneficial intention directed merely at relieving the suffering of others' headaches as a standard of comparison. If the merit from such a limited intention is so great, [22] what need is there to speak about the limitless merits of a Bodhisattva's pure intention? For his intention, deriving from his bodhichitta motivation, is to separate all sentient beings from all their suffering and lead them to the highest state of enlightenment. The Bodhisattva works not only to bring sentient beings temporary happiness but also to lead them to the ultimate happiness of Buddhahood.",
        "[23] Does even our father or mother have the same beneficial intention as the Bodhisattva has towards us? Do the great gods Brahma and Indra or even the wise sages have such a beneficial intention? No. It is true that our kind father and mother wish to dispel our temporary suffering and give us temporary happiness, but it does not occur to them to wish us the sublime joyful state of full awakening, the complete cessation of all our suffering.",
        "In general, ordinary beings like ourself, although we are filled with self-cherishing, strive only for the temporary happiness of this one life. We have no intention to attain the highest state of enlightenment, or even happiness for our future lives. Neither do we have the intention to find release from the sufferings of a hellish rebirth or from the sufferings of samsara as a whole. [24] If the beneficial intention to be released from all suffering and attain enlightenment never arises for our own sake, not even in our dreams, then how will it ever arise for the sake of others? If we have no wish to be free from samsara ourself then how will the wish arise for others to be free from samsara?",
        "If we meditate deeply by considering the constant suffering to which we are subjected we can develop the wish to be liberated from all the unsatisfactory states that make up samsara. This wish to be free is called 'renunciation'. If we reflect on the sufferings of those who are in the same situation as ourself, and realize that all sentient beings are suffering throughout samsara, the wish will arise that they also be freed. This is the development of true compassion, which leads to the generation of the bodhichitta wish.",
        "[25] Bodhichitta is the source of happiness for all sentient beings. It is the universal panacea relieving others of all their suffering. [26] How are we able to measure the infinite, unfathomable merit of this precious jewel-like mind? Is there any wonder comparable to the birth of the precious bodhichitta within our mind?",
        "To benefit another being is certainly a great practice, but for our beneficial intention to be pure it should not be mixed with such defilements as attachment. Only when it lacks such contaminations will great merit follow. [27] And if, as it is said, the pure intention merely to benefit a single sentient being is superior to making vast offerings to infinite Buddhas, what need is there to speak of a Bodhisattva's beneficial intention? With pure bodhichitta he or she wishes to separate every sentient being from suffering and to lead every one to the unchangeable bliss of unsurpassable enlightenment.",
        "To understand the scope of a Bodhisattva's activity and to realize how powerful are the results of his or her motivation, consider the following. If we have a beneficial intention towards one hundred beings then one hundred merits will arise. Similarly if our beneficial intention is directed towards one thousand beings then one thousand merits will arise. If this beneficial intention is directed towards countless beings then the merits that arise will also be countless. Therefore the fruits that arise from the bodhichitta motivation are limitless. Why? Because the object of bodhichitta is the countless sentient beings inhabiting the universe.",
        "[28] Someone might say that a Bodhisattva does not need to dispel the sufferings of sentient beings and lead them to happiness because they will do this by themselves. But in fact ordinary beings are completely ignorant of the law of actions and their effects. Therefore, although they all wish to be free from misery they nevertheless run straight towards it, which they do by their constant and ignorant creation of non-virtue, the very cause of their suffering. Similarly, although they wish for nothing but happiness they systematically destroy virtue, the cause of happiness, as if it were their worst enemy.",
        "[29] In short, sentient beings do not know the method to attain freedom from suffering. They are deprived of happiness and always afflicted by pain and sorrow. It is the Bodhisattva who, by the power of the precious bodhichitta, dispels their suffering and leads them to happiness. [30] Therefore, where is there a virtue comparable to bodhichitta, the mind of enlightenment that dispels the confusion of all beings, eradicates their suffering and bestows upon them boundless joy? Where is there a friend equal to the precious bodhichitta who accomplishes all benefit and prevents all harm? Where is there merit similar to that of the mind of enlightenment?",
        "PRAISE TO THE ONE WHO GIVES BIRTH TO BODHICHITTA",
        "[31] In this world we generally respect and praise a person who repays the kindness he or she has received from another. If this is so, how can we even begin to speak of the great kindness shown by the Bodhisattva, that infinitely compassionate being who benefits others whether or not they have benefited him? Bound by great compassion the Bodhisattva unconditionally helps all sentient beings by leading them in countless ways from suffering to happiness. Is there any need to speak of the praise and veneration due to such a glorious being?",
        "[32] Perhaps there is a person who gives a little food to a few beggars, enough to satisfy them for half a day. Even if he performs this charity with resentment and bad feelings, what is the general reaction to his deeds? The beggars are grateful and the man is praised by others who say, 'He is a great benefactor and has accumulated much virtue.' [33] If this is so then what need is there to speak of the praise and veneration due to the Bodhisattva? This peerless benefactor strives, for as long as samsara exists, to fulfil not only the temporary wishes of countless sentient beings but also the ultimate aim of bestowing upon them the matchless delights of the Awakened Ones. When we understand these reasons well we should always generate the deepest respect for these Bodhisattvas. By merely rejoicing in their beneficial actions we accumulate boundless merit.",
        "Some may wonder what the Bodhisattva does to practise temporary and ultimate generosity towards others. There are a great variety of possible activities because the Bodhisattva always acts according to the different dispositions of individual beings. Sometimes he or she will benefit others by teaching, sometimes by bestowing material aid and sometimes by protecting those in danger or great fear. Very advanced Bodhisattvas are able to manifest in different forms according to the needs of others. Depending upon the situation and the need it is possible for them to manifest as friends, helpers, or even inanimate objects. However, the main way a Bodhisattva benefits others is by teaching them Dharma, for this is the actual method that can lead sentient beings from the sufferings of samsara to the state of highest enlightenment. But, if certain beings lack interest in Dharma the Bodhisattva will be unable to teach them. Therefore, for these beings he manifests according to their temporary needs.",
        "This account of a Bodhisattva's deeds may sound unbelievable, and it may be difficult for us to accept all of this at the present time. But if we become acquainted with and eventually understand the vast Mahayana Dharma, we will realize that a Bodhisattva's deeds are actually like this. Thus first we should listen to Dharma teachings, and afterwards we will begin to understand and appreciate their qualities.",
        "In Tibet there was a Lama named Purchog Jampa Rinpoche who had a disciple called Kachen Yeshe Gyaltsen. This disciple lived beneath the cave of his Teacher and was often without sufficient food and clothing. One day a nobleman came to visit and offered Yeshe Gyaltsen a sack of barley flour, or tsampa, and some butter. Afterwards the disciple thought, 'I must be quite a special person for an aristocrat to give me these offerings.'",
        "The next day Jampa Rinpoche gave teachings. In the middle of his discourse he said, 'One of my students is unaware of the fact that a Lama can manifest as tsampa and butter.' Then looking directly at Yeshe Gyaltsen he continued, 'This student thinks that it is solely due to his own merits that these provisions are offered to him.' Suddenly Yeshe Gyaltsen realized that both the nobleman and his gifts were all the manifestation of his Guru, and a feeling of strong devotion and faith arose in his mind.",
        "Stories such as this one, however, are not easily received by new ears. Therefore it may be difficult to accept and believe such things. If we want to know whether a particular food is delicious or not we can only find out by tasting it. In the same way it is only by practising the teachings of Buddha that we will understand the qualities of Dharma. At the moment we have not yet experienced the taste of the Mahayana Dharma, so of course it is difficult to accept. But if we eat this food we will come to know its taste.",
        "As for the Bodhisattva, his or her ultimate work is to lead all sentient beings to the attainment of enlightenment. To do this, preparation is needed. If we were to invite a king or some other high dignitary to our house, we would make elaborate preparation in advance. In the same way, the Bodhisattva wishes to invite all his guests, the countless mother sentient beings, to the banquet of supreme Buddhahood. He prepares for this now by seeking Buddhahood himself. When he attains this lofty state he will be able to relieve all sentient beings of their suffering and place them in the bliss of enlightenment. Thus the Bodhisattva is our kindest benefactor, the one who fulfils all our temporary and ultimate wishes.",
        "At this point a doubt may arise. If, as stated, a Buddha has the ability to relieve all beings of their suffering, why have the countless Buddhas of the past not yet led everyone to enlightenment by now? The answer is as follows. Because Buddhas have overcome all obstructions and limitations they possess all the wisdom, compassion and skilful means necessary for leading others to Buddhahood. However, if sentient beings from their own side do not exert the necessary effort -- if they do not bother to follow the path shown to them by the Buddhas -- they will remain stuck within samsara. As has often been said, a Buddha cannot remove another's suffering and delusions the way we can pluck a thorn from another's flesh. Without a cooperative effort, nothing can be achieved. Merely relying upon an enlightened being is not enough.",
        "Shantideva continues by advising us how to behave towards a Bodhisattva. [34] He quotes Buddha Shakyamuni as having said that one moment of anger directed towards a Bodhisattva -- this peerless benefactor of all sentient beings -- contaminates the mind with an enormous non-virtuous residue. As a result we will abide in the intensely suffering realm of the hell beings for as many aeons as there were moments of anger. [35] However, if we generate a virtuous mind, such as faith, towards a Bodhisattva, the fruits of this action will multiply even more abundantly than the results of an angry mind. While anger towards a Bodhisattva is thousands of times more non-virtuous than anger towards an ordinary being, faith in a Bodhisattva is far more meritorious than faith in an ordinary object.",
        "Bodhichitta has so many good qualities and leads to so many beneficial results that the body of one who has developed this supremely precious mind is worthy to be an object of our prostrations. In one of his previous lifetimes as a Bodhisattva, Buddha Shakyamuni appeared as King Maitribala. He was wise, charitable and well-loved by his subjects, and soon his fame spread far and wide. Eventually news of this king reached the abode of five cannibalistic demons. They became very jealous of his good qualities and as a result plotted to murder him. Knowing his reputation for generosity they appeared before him and begged for charity. The king immediately gave them much gold and silver, but instead of accepting this they replied, 'This is an inappropriate offering; we are cannibals so please give us your flesh and blood.' The king assented to this gruesome request and as he gave them some of his blood he prayed, 'As I am now satisfying them with my blood may I one day satisfy them with pure Dharma and thereby be of true benefit to them.' When this king was later reborn as Buddha Shakyamuni, these five demons were reborn as his first disciples. After listening to Buddha's first discourse, delivered in Sarnath and initiating the first turning of the Wheel of Dharma, these five became Arhats, attaining complete personal liberation from all suffering. [36] Thus even to those who do them harm Bodhisattvas return temporary and ultimate joy and benefit. Since these Bodhisattvas are the foundation for all sentient beings' happiness it is appropriate that we take continuous refuge in them.",
        "Although there are numerous Mahayana practices, of both Sutra and Tantra, there is no practice more important than bodhichitta. By following the path of Tantra it is possible to attain enlightenment in one short lifetime. However, if we have not developed bodhichitta it does not matter how much or for how long we practise; it will be utterly impossible to attain enlightenment. Thus it is a great mistake to think that since Tantra is the quick path to enlightenment we should enter into it immediately and completely forget about developing bodhichitta. Such a misguided way of practising Dharma will be completely empty of results.",
        "It is extremely important to follow the spiritual path correctly and gradually, without omitting any of its stages. To train our mind in this way is to emulate the examples of such great practitioners as Milarepa, who attained enlightenment in one lifetime. Milarepa once said, 'First I feared the eight states of bondage. I meditated on impermanence, death and the shortcomings of samsara. I observed very carefully the law of actions and their effects, and relied solely upon the Three precious and sublime Jewels of refuge. For a long time I trained in the two methods for developing bodhichitta. Later I came to see that whatever appeared to my mind lacked true existence and was like an illusion. Now I have no fear of rebirth in the lower realms.' Such a well-ordered method of practice should be our guide as we follow the Bodhisattva path.",

As already stated, bodhichitta is a spontaneous and continuous state of mind that seeks enlightenment solely for the benefit of all sentient beings. Shantideva says [15] that this mind is of two types: aspiring bodhichitta and engaging bodhichitta. To understand the significance of and the distinctions between these two types of mind it is helpful to be familiar with the traditional methods of cultivating bodhichitta.",
        "Bodhichitta can be developed by following either of two methods: (1) the sevenfold cause and effect instructions, or (2) equalizing and exchanging self with others. The first method was originally taught by Buddha Shakyamuni and subsequently passed through Maitreya and Asanga in an unbroken lineage to such masters as Serlingpa and Atisha. The second method -- equalizing and exchanging self with others -- was designed specifically for those of sharp intelligence. It was also taught by Buddha Shakyamuni and passed through Manjushri in an unbroken lineage of Indian Masters to Shantideva himself. Both lineages have survived to the present day and are currently held by accomplished Teachers of all traditions of Mahayana Buddhism.",

What follows is an explanation of developing bodhichitta by means of meditating on the sevenfold cause and effect instructions. This method flourished widely throughout India and Tibet, and by studying it we will see that bodhichitta is not something that can be attained instantly, but rather is the result of a gradual training and development of the mind.",

        "Before we begin our meditation on the sevenfold cause and effect it is helpful first of all to meditate on equanimity. At present our mind is unsettled and biased; instead of looking at all beings equally with the eye of compassion, we feel very close towards some and very distant from, or even hostile towards, others. In such an unbalanced state it is very difficult to recognize all beings as our mothers -- the first of the seven cause and effect realizations. Therefore, if our meditation is to be successful we must first try to remove our prejudices by cultivating an attitude of equanimity.",
        "Briefly outlined, the way to develop equanimity is as follows. First we should bring to mind three people we presently regard as our enemy, our friend and a stranger. Then we should ask ourself why we have categorized them in this way. Upon inspection we will find that the person we now call our enemy has received this label because of some harm -- great or small, mental or physical, real or imagined -- he or she has given us in the past. If we think back, however, we can often remember occasions when this same person treated us with much kindness. And if we could see into our past lives (as will be discussed later) we would undoubtedly discover instances in which this so-called enemy was our selflessly kind mother, feeding us with her own milk and protecting us from harm and fear. Even without considering any lifetime but the present, we can see how temporary and easily subject to change the status of an enemy really is. If tomorrow we were to receive some unexpected assistance, praise or merely a kind word from this person, would we still regard him or her as our foe?",
        "The same considerations can then be applied to the person we now call our dear friend. Although the sight, or even the mere thought, of him or her now elicits a warm feeling in our heart, this was not always the case. There were times, either earlier in this lifetime or in previous lives, when this dear friend or relative was our chief enemy and, as such, inflicted great suffering upon us. And it can easily happen that because of some slight difference of opinion, hasty word, or thoughtless act we suddenly find ourselves estranged from the same person to whom we are now so attached.",

        "By using examples from our own and others' experiences and employing various lines of logical reasoning, we can become convinced that it is extremely short-sighted and ultimately very mistaken to think that anyone is permanently or inherently a friend, enemy or stranger to us.

If we feel justified in generating hatred towards our present enemy, then we should feel obliged to direct this hatred towards everyone, for sometime in the past we considered each person our enemy. And if it is correct to feel attached and biased towards our present friend because of some benefit we have received from him or her recently, then we should feel similarly towards everyone, because at one time or another everyone has been extremely kind to us, even to the point of being our mother.",
        "If we exert enough energy in meditation, acquainting ourself with the above reasons and examples and try to view people in an altered status, we will come to see how narrow-minded it is to be very close to some beings while remaining hostile or indifferent to others. Instead of assenting, as we do now, to a hard and fast classification of friend, enemy and stranger, and therefore being biased in our outlook, we can develop true equanimity -- the basis of the love and compassion necessary if we are to generate the precious bodhichitta and achieve enlightenment. As this is such an extremely worthwhile goal, we should not let our current prejudices go unexamined but expose them in the manner described.",
        "At this point a doubt may arise with respect to the meditation just described. It has been stated that the purpose of developing equanimity is to prepare us to recognize all beings as our mother. We may therefore wonder, 'If it is correct for me to regard all beings as my mother because they have supposedly been my mother in the past, then isn't it likewise correct for me to regard everyone as my enemy for the same reason?' To recognize the fallacy of this conclusion we must understand that whenever we have called anyone our enemy we have done so for basically unsound reasons and as the result of a mistaken view on our part. The habit of blaming our troubles and suffering on others -- on the so-called enemy -- is a deluded way of thinking, one that fails to realize that it is our own state of mind and not any external circumstance that is ultimately responsible for whatever misery we experience.",
        "At the root of our decision to regard someone as our enemy is a false projection of our mind, a mistaken conception of events. Forgetting such things as the kindness and parental nurturing this person has given us, and unaware of our own culpability for our suffering, we take the harm we receive from another as a valid justification for calling him or her our enemy and treating him with hostility. Although this is something we do all the time, it is in fact completely deluded and ultimately indefensible. On the other hand, as will be explained in the following section, there is nothing false or deluded about regarding all beings as our mother. This is true and verifiable, and not only opens the gateway for continued spiritual growth but provides us with an immediate experience of happiness and well-being.",
        "The goal of equanimity meditation is to remove all biased attitudes of mind and thereby to view all beings without discrimination as our mother. This in turn will motivate us to consider how we can repay their infinite kindness. If, as a result of this meditation, we are able to regard even our most hated enemy as our kind mother, we are ready to gain a realization of the first stage of the seven causes and effects leading to the development of bodhichitta."

        "Before we begin our meditation on the sevenfold cause and effect it is helpful first of all to meditate on equanimity. At present our mind is unsettled and biased; instead of looking at all beings equally with the eye of compassion, we feel very close towards some and very distant from, or even hostile towards, others. In such an unbalanced state it is very difficult to recognize all beings as our mothers -- the first of the seven cause and effect realizations. Therefore, if our meditation is to be successful we must first try to remove our prejudices by cultivating an attitude of equanimity.",
        "Briefly outlined, the way to develop equanimity is as follows. First we should bring to mind three people we presently regard as our enemy, our friend and a stranger. Then we should ask ourself why we have categorized them in this way. Upon inspection we will find that the person we now call our enemy has received this label because of some harm -- great or small, mental or physical, real or imagined -- he or she has given us in the past. If we think back, however, we can often remember occasions when this same person treated us with much kindness. And if we could see into our past lives (as will be discussed later) we would undoubtedly discover instances in which this so-called enemy was our selflessly kind mother, feeding us with her own milk and protecting us from harm and fear. Even without considering any lifetime but the present, we can see how temporary and easily subject to change the status of an enemy really is. If tomorrow we were to receive some unexpected assistance, praise or merely a kind word from this person, would we still regard him or her as our foe?",
        "The same considerations can then be applied to the person we now call our dear friend.

        "RECOGNIZING THAT ALL LIVING BEINGS ARE OUR MOTHERS",
        "Once we have developed an unbiased outlook towards all beings we are ready to view them all equally as having been our mother. This is the firm foundation upon which the supremely altruistic mind of bodhichitta depends. But how is it possible to recognize all beings as our mother? What are the reasons for believing we have shared the intimate mother-child relationship with everyone?",
        "To answer these questions, consider the following line of reasoning. The woman we presently recognize as our mother is such by virtue of our having been born into the world from her womb. Yet this is not the first and only time we have taken birth. The continuity of our consciousness stretches back over infinite time and the births we have taken have been countless. As we have been born countless times it follows that we have had countless mothers. Thus there is not a single being we meet who, over the incalculable expanse of beginningless time, has failed to be our mother. Despite the altered form and appearance of those we encounter, and the failings of our extremely limited memory, once we become convinced of the logic of the above line of reasoning there will be nothing to prevent us from viewing each being with the same warm recognition we now effortlessly extend to our present mother.",
        "Although the argument presented above is internally consistent, it is obvious that it will be completely lacking in persuasiveness if we do not come to understand and at least tentatively accept the existence of past and future lives. As long as we reject this possibility -- as long as we cling to the belief that our birth and death of this lifetime mark the outermost boundaries of our existence -- it will be utterly impossible for us to recognize all beings as our mother, except metaphorically. Many other important Dharma topics, such as the workings of cause and effect, also depend for their full understanding on a consideration of past and future lives. Therefore, although this topic may present particular difficulties to some people, especially in the modern world, it is very important that we try to keep an open mind and examine the issue with as few preconceptions as possible.",
        "The crux of the matter is our understanding of the nature of the mind, for it is through realizing that our mind is a formless continuum and that this continuum is beginningless that we will be able to understand the existence of previous lives. One way to meditate on this is as follows. We can look at our present stream of thoughts, perceptions and emotions -- all the factors we identify as being mental -- and trace it backwards to the mindstream of the previous moment, minute and hour. Then we can trace this mindstream even further backwards to yesterday, last week and last year. Depending upon the sharpness of our memory, we can trace this mindstream back year by year until we approach the time of our birth. Even if we can trace it back to our stay in the womb or the moment of conception, we can never point to a time and say, 'At this instant my mind came into being.'",
        "In fact, some people who do this backwards tracing meditation are able to go beyond the moment of conception and remember the mindstream existing at the end of a previous lifetime. However, as this experience is not shared by very many people (and is the object of many others' doubt) we cannot fairly use it as a proof that mind is a beginningless continuum. Rather, it is much more beneficial for us to gain a closer acquaintance with our own mind and question our own assumptions as to its nature and origin.",
        "To aid in this investigation, here are a few useful questions and observations to keep in mind. When we search for the source of our present body we eventually come to the combined sperm and ovum of our parents. Can this also be the source of our mindstream? If we answer yes, many difficulties arise. How do we account for the marked differences between our mind and those of our parents and siblings? If our mind is traceable to our parents' germ cells, what is the relation between these cells and our parents' minds? Is the mind something that can eventually be reduced to a physical cause or, being essentially formless, must it not have a non-physical cause of its own quite apart from the source of our physical body?",
        "Some people assert that the mind is a relatively blank slate at birth with but a few pre-natal impressions on it. They say that what we call the mind is merely the learned behaviour we acquire as we grow and develop. Is such a theory satisfactory? Does it take into account differences in temperament between people, differences that have been noted even in newborn infants of the same family? Does it account for the complexity of mental behaviour found in ordinary children, much less the unusual skills and aptitudes of exceptionally gifted youngsters?",
        "If we truly want to understand the nature of the mind and discover whether or not it is a beginningless continuum we must consider these questions carefully. It is a fact that most people, even the educated and those whose professions deal directly with mental phenomena, possess nothing more than a vague idea of what the mind is. If our own views are similarly indefinite -- if we do not have a coherent theory to explain the relationship between material form and non-material mind -- then it is not wise to reject out of hand a theory based on logic, observation, experience and the testimony of enlightened beings. At the very least we should remain open-minded and look at the issue impartially.",
        "According to Buddhist thought our stream of consciousness was present while we were a foetus. Going even further back to the moment of conception, this mindstream entered the embryonic cell formed by the union of our father's sperm and mother's ovum. Prior to this entry, this consciousness or mental continuum was the consciousness of a previous lifetime. Furthermore, the consciousness of that life arose from the one before that, and so on back into infinity. Even Buddha Shakyamuni's omniscient mind saw no beginning to this process. Therefore, if the continuity of mind is beginningless, we must have taken countless rebirths and therefore must have had countless mothers. Consequently there is not a single sentient being who has not at one time or another been our mother.",
        "If this is so why do we not intuitively recognize other beings as having been our mother? The reason is that the traumatic experiences of death and rebirth generally rob us of our memories of past lives. In addition, the way beings change form from one life to the next makes it difficult for us to recognize them. For example, if our present mother were to die and be reborn a dog, we would be completely unable to recognize her even if she eventually became our pet. Thus, despite appearances, we are presently surrounded by countless beings, who have each been our mother.",
        "It is important to remember that not all beings lack the ability to recall their previous existence. As a fruit of their meditative practices, in which the gross obscurations of the mind are progressively removed, many Yogis gain the ability to see their past lives. Even some ordinary people, especially young children, have memories of their past lives owing to especially clear imprints on their mind. The fact that most of us, however, do not have such memories is not so surprising. After all, even the obscurations of this lifetime and the general fogginess of our mind are enough to prevent us from remembering events from our early childhood, infancy and stay in the womb.",
        "Considering such lines of reasoning as presented above, and checking carefully to see if they are logical, non-contradictory, reasonable and applicable to our experience, is the process known as 'analytical meditation'. Arising from this process of examination is a conclusion, in this case a strong feeling that all beings have been our mother. The next step is to hold this feeling or conclusion by the power of our mindfulness, and remain upon it single-pointedly. This process is called 'placement meditation'. It is through the continual practice of placement meditation that true realizations dawn in our mind. When we become firm in the recognition that all sentient beings have been our mother, we have attained the realization of the first of the seven stages in the development of bodhichitta."

      "content": [
        "At this point a doubt may arise with respect to the meditation just described. It has been stated that the purpose of developing equanimity is to prepare us to recognize all beings as our mother. We may therefore wonder, aEUR~If it is correct for me to regard all beings as my mother because they have supposedly been my mother in the past, then isnaEUR(TM)t it likewise correct for me to regard everyone as my enemy for the same reason?aEUR(TM) To recognize the fallacy of this conclusion we must understand that whenever we have called anyone our enemy we have done so for basically unsound reasons and as the result of a mistaken view on our part. The habit of blaming our troubles and suffering on others aEUR\" on the so-called enemy aEUR\" is a deluded way of thinking, one that fails to realize that it is our own state of mind and not any external circumstance that is ultimately responsible for whatever misery we experience.",
        "At the root of our decision to regard someone as our enemy is a false projection of our mind, a mistaken conception of events. Forgetting such things as the kindness and parental nurturing this person has given us, and unaware of our own culpability for our suffering, we take the harm we receive from another as a valid justification for calling him or her our enemy and treating him with hostility. Although this is something we do all the time, it is in fact completely deluded and ultimately indefensible. On the other hand, as will be explained in the following section, there is nothing false or deluded about regarding all beings as our mother. This is true and verifiable, and not only opens the gateway for continued spiritual growth but provides us with an immediate experience of happiness and well-being.",
        "The goal of equanimity meditation is to remove all biased attitudes of mind and thereby to view all beings without discrimination as our mother. This in turn will motivate us to consider how we can repay their infinite kindness. If, as a result of this meditation, we are able to regard even our most hated enemy as our kind mother, we are ready to gain a realization of the first stage of the seven causes and effects leading to the development of bodhichitta.",
        "RECOGNIZING THAT ALL LIVING BEINGS ARE OUR MOTHERS",
        "Once we have developed an unbiased outlook towards all beings we are ready to view them all equally as having been our mother. This is the firm foundation upon which the supremely altruistic mind of bodhichitta depends. But how is it possible to recognize all beings as our mother? What are the reasons for believing we have shared the intimate mother-child relationship with everyone?",
        "To answer these questions, consider the following line of reasoning. The woman we presently recognize as our mother is such by virtue of our having been born into the world from her womb. Yet this is not the first and only time we have taken birth. The continuity of our consciousness stretches back over infinite time and the births we have taken have been countless. As we have been born countless times it follows that we have had countless mothers. Thus there is not a single being we meet who, over the incalculable expanse of beginningless time, has failed to be our mother. Despite the altered form and appearance of those we encounter, and the failings of our extremely limited memory, once we become convinced of the logic of the above line of reasoning there will be nothing to prevent us from viewing each being with the same warm recognition we now effortlessly extend to our present mother.",
        "Although the argument presented above is internally consistent, it is obvious that it will be completely lacking in persuasiveness if we do not come to understand and at least tentatively accept the existence of past and future lives. As long as we reject this possibility aEUR\" as long as we cling to the belief that our birth and death of this lifetime mark the outermost boundaries of our existence aEUR\" it will be utterly impossible for us to recognize all beings as our mother, except metaphorically. Many other important Dharma topics, such as the workings of cause and effect, also depend for their full understanding on a consideration of past and future lives. Therefore, although this topic may present particular difficulties to some people, especially in the modern world, it is very important that we try to keep an open mind and examine the issue with as few preconceptions as possible.",
        "The crux of the matter is our understanding of the nature of the mind, for it is through realizing that our mind is a formless continuum and that this continuum is beginningless that we will be able to understand the existence of previous lives. One way to meditate on this is as follows. We can look at our present stream of thoughts, perceptions and emotions aEUR\" all the factors we identify as being mental aEUR\" and trace it backwards to the mindstream of the previous moment, minute and hour. Then we can trace this mindstream even further backwards to yesterday, last week and last year. Depending upon the sharpness of our memory, we can trace this mindstream back year by year until we approach the time of our birth. Even if we can trace it back to our stay in the womb or the moment of conception, we can never point to a time and say, aEUR~At this instant my mind came into being.aEUR(TM)",
        "In fact, some people who do this backwards tracing meditation are able to go beyond the moment of conception and remember the mindstream existing at the end of a previous lifetime. However, as this experience is not shared by very many people (and is the object of many othersaEUR(TM) doubt) we cannot fairly use it as a proof that mind is a beginningless continuum. Rather, it is much more beneficial for us to gain a closer acquaintance with our own mind and question our own assumptions as to its nature and origin.",
        "To aid in this investigation, here are a few useful questions and observations to keep in mind. When we search for the source of our present body we eventually come to the combined sperm and ovum of our parents. Can this also be the source of our mindstream? If we answer yes, many difficulties arise. How do we account for the marked differences between our mind and those of our parents and siblings? If our mind is traceable to our parentsaEUR(TM) germ cells, what is the relation between these cells and our parentsaEUR(TM) minds? Is the mind something that can eventually be reduced to a physical cause or, being essentially formless, must it not have a non-physical cause of its own quite apart from the source of our physical body?",
        "Some people assert that the mind is a relatively blank slate at birth with but a few pre-natal impressions on it. They say that what we call the mind is merely the learned behaviour we acquire as we grow and develop. Is such a theory satisfactory? Does it take into account differences in temperament between people, differences that have been noted even in newborn infants of the same family? Does it account for the complexity of mental behaviour found in ordinary children, much less the unusual skills and aptitudes of exceptionally gifted youngsters?",
        "If we truly want to understand the nature of the mind and discover whether or not it is a beginningless continuum we must consider these questions carefully. It is a fact that most people, even the educated and those whose professions deal directly with mental phenomena, possess nothing more than a vague idea of what the mind is. If our own views are similarly indefinite aEUR\" if we do not have a coherent theory to explain the relationship between material form and non-material mind aEUR\" then it is not wise to reject out of hand a theory based on logic, observation, experience and the testimony of enlightened beings. At the very least we should remain open-minded and look at the issue impartially.",
        "According to Buddhist thought our stream of consciousness was present while we were a foetus. Going even further back to the moment of conception, this mindstream entered the embryonic cell formed by the union of our fatheraEUR(TM)s sperm and motheraEUR(TM)s ovum. Prior to this entry, this consciousness or mental continuum was the consciousness of a previous lifetime. Furthermore, the consciousness of that life arose from the one before that, and so on back into infinity. Even Buddha ShakyamuniaEUR(TM)s omniscient mind saw no beginning to this process. Therefore, if the continuity of mind is beginningless, we must have taken countless rebirths and therefore must have had countless mothers. Consequently there is not a single sentient being who has not at one time or another been our mother.",
        "If this is so why do we not intuitively recognize other beings as having been our mother? The reason is that the traumatic experiences of death and rebirth generally rob us of our memories of past lives. In addition, the way beings change form from one life to the next makes it difficult for us to recognize them. For example, if our present mother were to die and be reborn a dog, we would be completely unable to recognize her even if she eventually became our pet. Thus, despite appearances, we are presently surrounded by countless beings, who have each been our mother.",
        "It is important to remember that not all beings lack the ability to recall their previous existence. As a fruit of their meditative practices, in which the gross obscurations of the mind are progressively removed, many Yogis gain the ability to see their past lives. Even some ordinary people, especially young children, have memories of their past lives owing to especially clear imprints on their mind. The fact that most of us, however, do not have such memories is not so surprising. After all, even the obscurations of this lifetime and the general fogginess of our mind are enough to prevent us from remembering events from our early childhood, infancy and stay in the womb."

But such affection does not arise when we see other sentient beings, especially those who disturb us. If we are to develop true bodhichitta this warm feeling must be extended to embrace everyone. If as a result of long and continual meditation our mind becomes accustomed to looking upon each being with affection and warmth, we have realized this fourth stage in the development of the mind of enlightenment.",
        "DEVELOPING GREAT COMPASSION",
        "Great compassion is the state of mind that wishes each and every being to be free from all suffering. If we have already developed affectionate, heart-warming love and have extended it towards all living beings, then when we meditate deeply on the suffering that others are now experiencing a feeling of great compassion will arise easily. Thus the primary cause of great compassion is our previous development of affectionate love.",
        "The mind of great compassion embraces all sentient beings without exception. At present we are unable to bear our own suffering because we cherish ourself so deeply. In addition we cannot bear to see the suffering of our parents, family and friends because we cherish them as well. However, when we see our enemies in pain we take delight in the knowledge that they are suffering. Why? Because we do not cherish them at all. It is this prejudiced mind that we must tame and transform. We do this by familiarizing ourself with the first four stages until we spontaneously look upon all beings as we do our kind mother. Then, by remembering their suffering and dissatisfaction, we will easily develop great compassion. The measure of this development is that when confronted by a former enemy the spontaneous wish arises that he or she be free from all misery. As has been said, until we have developed affectionate love for all others, we will be unable to develop this great compassion for them.",
        "There are two traditions regarding the development of affectionate love. That of such Indian Masters as Chandragomin and Chandrakirti states that affectionate love is the result of deepening the realization of the first three stages as explained above. According to the tradition of Shantideva, this heart-warming affection is developed mainly through the method of exchanging ourself with others, as will be explained later.",
        "As already mentioned, if we develop affectionate, heart-warming love for all beings and then focus in meditation on their suffering, we can develop the mind of great compassion, wishing them to be released from their misery. If we focus instead on their lack of pure happiness aEUR\" how they are deprived of true pleasures and joys aEUR\" then our affectionate love develops into what is known as aEUR~wishing loveaEUR(TM). This is the heartfelt wish that no sentient being is ever separated from happiness and its causes.",
        "DEVELOPING SUPERIOR INTENTION",
        "Upon the full realization of great compassion the thought will arise, aEUR~I myself will undertake the task of liberating all beings from suffering; this is solely my duty and responsibility.aEUR(TM) Assuming personal responsibility for the release of all sentient beings in this way is called aEUR~superior intentionaEUR(TM). This can be explained further by an example. If a child is drowning in a river, the onlookers will have the heartfelt wish that she be rescued. If the childaEUR(TM)s father sees this danger, however, he will not be satisfied with merely wishing her to be saved. Instead there will arise in him the strong intention to act to save his child. He will think, aEUR~I myself will rescue her.aEUR(TM) The mind of the onlookers is like great compassion, while the mind of the father is like superior intention.",
        "Someone who has developed this superior intention, although having the strong desire to act for the liberation of all sentient beings, soon realizes that he or she has no power to accomplish this aim. Like a father who is disabled and therefore cannot respond to his childaEUR(TM)s call for help, such a person is unable to fulfil this altruistic wish. A deep realization of this predicament aEUR\" the inability to act upon our wishes aEUR\" leads to the following intended result of this meditation.",
        "DEVELOPING BODHICHITTA",
        "Through contemplation and examination we will discover that only a completely perfect being who has awakened from the sleep of ignorance, a fully enlightened Buddha, has the complete power to liberate others from their suffering. The truth of this becomes clear when we think about the attributes a true liberator of others must have. Such a being would have to possess the four characteristics of an Awakened One:",
        "(1)\tFreedom from all obstructions preventing liberation and omniscience",
        "(2)\tGreat skill in liberating living beings from their suffering",
        "(3)\tCompassion for all living beings without discrimination",
        "(4)\tBenefiting all living beings whether or not they have helped him",
        "In this world we do not find any ordinary person who has such qualities. Any being who does have these four characteristics is what Buddhists refer to when they use the title aEUR~BuddhaaEUR(TM). In the past many people in eastern countries have earned this title by developing supreme qualities through meditation on the Mahayana path. It is my hope that in this present day many people throughout the world also may develop these precious qualities and likewise achieve Buddhahood.",
        "In conclusion, when the sixth realization, superior intention, has been developed and we subsequently recognize that only a Buddha endowed with the four above-mentioned qualities has the full power to fulfil this pure wish, we achieve the intended result of this meditation. In our mind arises the continuous thought to seek the full enlightenment of Buddhahood in order to benefit all mother sentient beings and remove them from suffering. This is the mind of enlightenment, bodhichitta, and anyone who develops it is called aEUR~BodhisattvaaEUR(TM).",
        "As Shantideva stated in the previous verse, while there are many types of bodhichitta they are all contained within the following two aspects: the aspiring mind and the engaging, or venturing, mind. [16] These can be likened to the wish to go somewhere and the actual going. First the mind aspiring or wishing to go to the destination arises, and it continues to arise while the journey is being made. In a similar fashion, the aspiring mind of bodhichitta seeks to attain enlightenment for the benefit of all sentient beings, and it continues to arise until this goal is achieved. As for the engaging mind, it begins when the Bodhisattva vows have been received. It is at this point that we actually engage in the practices leading to enlightenment aEUR\" the six perfections and the other virtues.",
        "The two aspects of bodhichitta are stabilized within our mind by keeping the appropriate precepts and vows. First, in the presence of an actual Preceptor or the visualized assembly of Buddhas, we commit ourself to the aspiring mind. At this time we promise never to abandon this mind but to hold it firmly until enlightenment is reached. Then we take the following eight precepts to prevent this aspiring mind from degenerating in this life and in all future lives. For the sake of this life we vow:",
        "(1)\tTo remember the benefits of bodhichitta six times a day",
        "(2)\tTo generate bodhichitta six times a day",
        "(3)\tNot to abandon any living being",
        "(4)\tTo accumulate merit and wisdom"
